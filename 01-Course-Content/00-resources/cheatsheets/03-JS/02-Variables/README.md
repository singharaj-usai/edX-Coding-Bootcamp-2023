# Variables in JavaScript
Variables are stand-in values that you can use to perform operations. You should be familiar with them from math class.

### *var, const, let*
You have three different possibilities for declaring a variable in JavaScript, each with their own specialties:

* **var** — The most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with **var** move to the top when the code is executed.

* **const** — Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.

* **let** — Similar to **const**, the **let** variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.

### Data Types
Variables can contain different types of values and data types. You use = to assign them:

* Numbers — **var age = 23**

* Variables — **var x**

* Text (strings) — **var a = "init"**

* Operations — **var b = 1 + 2 + 3**

* True or false statements — **var c = true**

* Constant numbers — **const PI = 3.14**

* Objects — **var name = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}**

There are more possibilities. Note that variables are case sensitive. That means lastname and lastName will be handled as two different variables.

### Objects
Objects are certain kinds of variables. They are variables that can have their own values and methods. The latter are actions that you can perform on objects.

```js
var person = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName:"Doe",
    age:20,
    nationality:"German"
};
```
