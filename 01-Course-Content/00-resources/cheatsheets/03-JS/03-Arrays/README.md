# The Next Level: Arrays
Next up in our JavaScript cheat sheet are arrays. Arrays are part of many different programming languages. They are a way of organizing variables and properties into groups. Here’s how to create one in JavaScript:

```js
var fruit = ["Banana", "Apple", "Pear"];
```

Now you have an array called **fruit** which contains three items that you can use for future operations.

### Array Methods
Once you have created arrays, there are a few things you can do with them:

* **concat()** — Join several arrays into one

* **indexOf()** — Returns the first position at which a given element appears in an array

* **join()** — Combine elements of an array into a single string and return the string

* **lastIndexOf()** — Gives the last position at which a given element appears in an array

* **pop()** — Removes the last element of an array

* **push()** — Add a new element at the end

* **reverse()** — Sort elements in a descending order

* **shift()** — Remove the first element of an array

* **slice()** — Pulls a copy of a portion of an array into a new array

* **sort()** — Sorts elements alphabetically

* **splice()** — Adds elements in a specified way and position

* **toString()** — Converts elements to strings

* **unshift()** —Adds a new element to the beginning

* **valueOf()** — Returns the primitive value of the specified object
