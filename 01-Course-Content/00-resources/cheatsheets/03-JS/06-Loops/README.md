# JavaScript Loops
Loops are part of most programming languages. They allow you to execute blocks of code desired number of times with different values:

```js
for (before loop; condition for loop; execute after loop) {
    // what to do during the loop
}
```

You have several parameters to create loops:

* for — The most common way to create a loop in JavaScript
* while — Sets up conditions under which a loop executes
* do while — Similar to the while loop but it executes at least once and performs a check at the end to see if the condition is met to execute again
* break —Used to stop and exit the cycle at certain conditions
* continue — Skip parts of the cycle if certain conditions are met
