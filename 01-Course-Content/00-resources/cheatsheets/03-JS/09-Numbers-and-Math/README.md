# Numbers and Math
In JavaScript, you can also work with numbers, constants and perform mathematical functions.

## Number Properties
* MAX_VALUE — The maximum numeric value representable in JavaScript

* MIN_VALUE — Smallest positive numeric value representable in JavaScript

* NaN — The “Not-a-Number” value

* NEGATIVE_INFINITY — The negative Infinity value

* POSITIVE_INFINITY — Positive Infinity value

## Number Methods
* toExponential() — Returns the string with a rounded number written as exponential notation

* toFixed() — Returns the string of a number with a specified number of decimals

* toPrecision() — String of a number written with a specified length

* toString() — Returns a number as a string

* valueOf() — Returns a number as a number

## Math Properties
* E — Euler’s number

* LN2 — The natural logarithm of 2

* LN10 — Natural logarithm of 10

* LOG2E — Base 2 logarithm of E

* LOG10E — Base 10 logarithm of E

* PI — The number PI

* SQRT1_2 — Square root of 1/2

* SQRT2 — The square root of 2

## Math Methods
* abs(x) — Returns the absolute (positive) value of x

* acos(x) — The arccosine of x, in radians

* asin(x) — Arcsine of x, in radians

* atan(x) — The arctangent of x as a numeric value

* atan2(y,x) — Arctangent of the quotient of its arguments

* ceil(x) — Value of x rounded up to its nearest integer

* cos(x) — The cosine of x (x is in radians)

* exp(x) — Value of E^x

* floor(x) — The value of x rounded down to its nearest integer

* log(x) — The natural logarithm (base E) of x

* max(x,y,z,...,n) — Returns the number with the highest value

* min(x,y,z,...,n) — Same for the number with the lowest value

* pow(x,y) — X to the power of y

* random() — Returns a random number between 0 and 1

* round(x) — The value of x rounded to its nearest integer

* sin(x) — The sine of x (x is in radians)

* sqrt(x) — Square root of x

* tan(x) — The tangent of an angle
