# Dealing with Dates in JavaScript
You can also work with and modify dates and time with JavaScript. This is the next chapter in the JavaScript cheat sheet.

## Setting Dates
* Date() — Creates a new date object with the current date and time

* Date(2017, 5, 21, 3, 23, 10, 0) — Create a custom date object. The numbers represent a year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, milliseconds. You can omit anything you want except for a year and month.

* Date("2017-06-23") — Date declaration as a string

## Pulling Date and Time Values
* getDate() — Get the day of the month as a number (1-31)

* getDay() —  The weekday as a number (0-6)

* getFullYear() — Year as a four-digit number (yyyy)

* getHours() — Get the hour (0-23)

* getMilliseconds() — The millisecond (0-999)

* getMinutes() — Get the minute (0-59)

* getMonth() —  Month as a number (0-11)

* getSeconds() — Get the second (0-59)

* getTime() — Get the milliseconds since January 1, 1970

* getUTCDate() — The day (date) of the month in the specified date according to universal time (also available for day, month, full year, hours, minutes etc.)

* parse — Parses a string representation of a date and returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970

## Set Part of a Date
* setDate() — Set the day as a number (1-31)

* setFullYear() — Sets the year (optionally month and day)

* setHours() — Set the hour (0-23)

* setMilliseconds() — Set milliseconds (0-999)

* setMinutes() — Sets the minutes (0-59)

* setMonth() — Set the month (0-11)

* setSeconds() — Sets the seconds (0-59)

* setTime() — Set the time (milliseconds since January 1, 1970)
