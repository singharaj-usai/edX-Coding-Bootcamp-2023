# Object Oriented Programming
Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, is the idea that all code should be grouped into "boxes" (objects) to make your program easier to read and understand. Keeping the data encapsulated helps to keep the program organized. Each object has a state that defines what it does and methods (functions on an object) that can use or modify the state. Considering almost everything in JavaScript is an object, you would think this would be easy to do. Say we want to create a game that has lots of characters that all have different abilities. How would we go about this?

```js
const elf1 = {
  name: 'Dobby',
  type: 'house',
  weapon: 'cloth',
  say: function() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`
  }
  attack: function() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`
  }
}

const elf2 = {
  name: 'Legolas',
  type: 'high',
  weapon: 'bow',
  say: function() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`
  }
  attack: function() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`
  }
}

elf1.attack()
// attack with cloth
elf2.attack()
// attack with bow
```
