# 0.1.1 Welcome to the Coding Boot Camp

Welcome to the Live Online Coding Boot Camp! This challenging and rewarding program is designed to push you outside of your comfort zone and prepare you with the technical skills and mindset to become a full-stack web developer. This will engage you with real-life scenarios to learn the necessary concepts and skills, as well as provide you with a robust community of support.

Each week, you'll gain proficiency in coding languages, web technologies, and software development concepts. You'll move through three phases of the program: foundation, technical, and performance, to build on and refine the skills you are learning. At the end of each phase of the program, you'll build a well-designed and functional project that addresses a real-world challenge. And you'll have a community of support to help you along the way!

With hard work and dedication, you'll reach your goal and transition from boot camp student to a successful professional full-stack web developer.
