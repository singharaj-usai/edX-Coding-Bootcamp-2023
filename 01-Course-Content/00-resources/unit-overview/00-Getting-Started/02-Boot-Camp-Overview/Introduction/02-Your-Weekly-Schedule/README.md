# 0.2.3 Your Weekly Schedule

The Live Online Coding Bootcamp is designed to provide you with engaging face-to-face class time, independent practice, and group projects to simulate the real world of web development.

Each week you'll attend class for ten hours and engage in hands-on activities with your peers to solidify the concepts and skills you're learning. You'll develop real-world solutions and demonstrate your new skills by completing web development projects called Challenge assignments. You should plan to spend about 20 hours or more a week on studying and on your assignments, knowing that some weeks you will spend longer than others. Additionally, your instructor and TAs will hold Office Hours before and after the class session to support your learning and progress.

You are allowed to miss up to 8 classes. If you plan to miss class, please notify your instructor as soon as possible.

Read more about the course structure and expectations on this page to start thinking about how you'll build your schedule to stay accountable and on track with assignments and projects.

# Live Sessions
During the live class sessions, the instructor will provide you with expert and industry relevant lectures, live coding demonstrations, and opportunities to practice in groups. You'll engage in real work scenarios and activities to solidify the new skills you are learning. It is important to show up to class ready to actively participate in the whole class and breakout activities. As a reminder, you can attend Office Hours before and after class for individualized support and questions.

# Online Bootcamp Spot Materials
Each week you will have access to some online materials to prepare and support you in the corresponding module. The online module content contains the tools and technologies you'll use during the week: support documents like blog posts and user guides, the challenge requirements, and resources to help you further your goal towards becoming a professional web developer. Review this information as it becomes available to prepare for your live sessions and for questions you might have for office hours.

## Challenges and Projects
Each week you'll complete and submit a Challenge assignment. The Challenge is a practical application that incorporates the content you’ve learned in that module. The details, requirements, and submission instructions for each week’s Challenge are located on Bootcamp Spot. Consider reviewing the Challenge instructions and requirements as early in your week as possible.

## Career Development Materials
Each module concludes with a Career Connection section to review the real-world application of the material covered that week. You'll have access to open source projects, technical assessments, strategies for career development, and much more. Take some time to review the materials and focus on what aligns with your professional goals.

### Employer-Ready Baseline
**Employer-Ready** means that you have the minimum requirements to enter into a typical job application process with complete job search materials. **Employer-Competitive** means that you have given yourself the best chance to secure your desired job—your job-search materials are excellent, you are well-prepared for interviews, and you are proactively seeking and pursuing the jobs that you want with multiple networking strategies.

We encourage everyone to become employer-ready, which means having a basic resume or CV and strong online presence (ex: LinkedIn). Employer-ready means that you:
* Meet minimum application requirements.
* Have job search materials that are strong and complete.
* Could potentially get noticed, with luck, among a stack of applications.

To position yourself as a top candidate, we encourage you to take a few more steps to become employer-competitive. Employer-competitive means that you:
* Have developed excellent professional materials.
* Can successfully network.
* Have demonstrated a strong commitment to ongoing learning.
* Are proactive with effective outreach and follow-up strategies.
