# 0.2.4 Your Support Team

Completing this boot camp will be both rewarding and demanding. It won't always be easy. At times, you might find yourself working extra hard to learn a new concept. This can be frustrating, but know that these are the times when you'll actually learn the most!

Remember, you are not alone. You and all of the other students in your cohort will have a full team of talented professionals ready to help you at every step of the journey.

# Academic Team
The academic team will assist directly with anything related to coursework—the virtual classroom experience, asynchronous modules, and weekly challenges. This team consists of instructional staff dedicated directly to your class as well as a centralized team of support.

## Dedicated Team 
Each class has a dedicated instructional team that will guide you through the virtual classroom experience. You'll spend a lot of time with this team (online, of course) while you complete your boot camp.

### Instructor
Your instructor is the lead facilitator of your learning experience in the virtual classroom. They manage the Virtual Class sessions and Office Hours before and after classes. They also monitor your progress in the course, providing feedback and assistance to help you reach your goals.

### Teaching Assistants (TAs)
During Virtual Classes, the TAs provide support and troubleshooting. They'll also provide critical feedback and evaluation that will ensure that you understand the concepts being covered and how they relate to previous material. They might also lead supplemental office hours as you near the end of the week.

## Centralized Team
The Centralized Team provides support to all boot camp students, providing help outside of the virtual classroom. This includes Learning Assistants, who can help you find an answer to specific technical questions, and tutors, who can enrich your understanding when you're not quite where you want to be.

### Learning Assistants
You'll have access to a virtual team of Learning Assistants on Slack. When you can't quite find the answer to one of your questions, you can submit it via an automated Slackbot called AskBCS that will pass your questions to the Learning Assistants. A Learning Assistant will reply to questions one at a time to help you and other students get an answer.

### Tutoring
Tutoring, also known as Central Support, is a free service that's available after you've exhausted all other resources. It is not a primary source of support and will only help if you're already devoting many hours per week to coding practice and study.

Every tutor on the team is either a boot camp graduate, a TA or substitute TA, or an industry professional. The one thing every tutor has in common is firsthand knowledge of the challenges of learning this content. Every tutor has a genuine desire to help you and to make your boot camp experience a little easier.

To arrange tutoring, you can use the support form within Bootcamp Spot or contact your Student Success Manager.

### Student Success Manager
The Student Success Manager (SSM) will guide you through the course from the time you enroll until the day you graduate. They'll support you every step of the way. That means answering your questions, offering encouragement, or simply cheering you on. They can also help you find support specific to your needs to help you reach your goals.

# Career Services
The Career Services team will help you build the job-search skills necessary to achieve your post boot camp goals. Career Services offers frequent online career events, including recent graduates offering job search advice, experienced tech industry professionals sharing insights and expertise, and behavioral and technical job interview practice.

Your **Profile Coach** will provide you with individualized feedback on your job search materials (resume, LinkedIn profile, GitHub).

Your **Career Coach** will help you to navigate the job search process by hosting open Office Hours and one-on-one meetings with you to discuss goals and help you prepare for the job search.
