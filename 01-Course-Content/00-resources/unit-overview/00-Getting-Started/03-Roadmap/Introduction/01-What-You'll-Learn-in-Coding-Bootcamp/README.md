# 0.3.2 What You’ll Learn in Coding Boot Camp
The boot camp is divided into three equal phases: Foundation, Technical, and Performance. You'll engage in live classes, practice outside of class, and build web applications to solve real-world problems. Read on for details on what you’ll learn and build during each phase of the boot camp.

# Phase 1: Foundation
The Foundation phase covers the fundamental concepts of web development, including front-end technologies, command-line fundamentals, and APIs.

In this phase, you'll learn the following skills:
* HTML and CSS
* Git
* JavaScript
* Third-party APIs (jQuery, Bootstrap)
* Server-side APIs, AJAX, and JSON

For the first project, you'll develop the front end yourself and leverage other people’s servers and APIs. Past students have created some pretty cool projects, including Food Finder, an app that helps you find recipes, and Fourth and Lawn, an app that helps you find parking at sporting events.

# Phase 2: Technical
In the Technical phase, you'll learn the skills necessary to engineer a complete full-stack web application. This includes working with servers, databases, and other back-end technologies and connecting them to the front end.

In this phase, you'll learn the following skills:
* Node.js
* Object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Express.js servers
* MySQL
* Object-relational mapper, or ORM (Sequelize)
* Model-view-controller (MVC) framework (Handlebars.js)
* Unit testing
* Agile methodology
* Heroku

As a group project for the second phase, you'll combine your ability to create a front-end website with your new ability to write server code, to create a web application that interacts with your server code.

This project will help you reinforce your existing front-end abilities and solidify how you conceive of the front-end and back-end dynamic. If your front-end fundamentals were solid at the end of the first section, you'll be building on a strong foundation as you undertake this project. An example of a student project from this stage is using JSON Web Tokens to make Recruit Analyzer, a basketball recruit simulator.

# Phase 3: Performance
In the Performance phase, you'll learn how to optimize your web applications for speed and efficiency—as well as prepare yourself for the transition to a career in web development.

In this phase, you'll learn the following skills:
* Computer science
* MongoDB and NoSQL
* Progressive web apps (PWAs)
* React
* MERN
* Portfolios

As a capstone to the boot camp, you’ll work with a group to build a full-stack application that uses a wide swath of the languages and libraries that you learned throughout the course. We can’t wait to find out what you build!
