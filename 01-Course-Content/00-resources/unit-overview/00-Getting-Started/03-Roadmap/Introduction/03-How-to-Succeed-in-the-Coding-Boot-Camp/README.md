# 0.3.4 How to Succeed in the Coding Boot Camp
Congratulations on your commitment to the coding boot camp. Your attitude plays a key role in your success! As you embark on the journey ahead, you'll need to align your attitude and expectations with reality. Follow these tips to ensure your success in this program and make it a rewarding learning experience.

## Overcome Frustration
The content and skills in this boot camp will challenge you. Reassure yourself that you'll improve, and approach each week as an opportunity to learn something new. Six months from now, you'll marvel at how far you've come!

## Take Charge of Your Learning
You'll get out of this program what you put into it. To succeed, you must take ownership of your learning experience.

Like any craft, coding requires diligence, practice and experimentation, and a desire to improve. Remind yourself that you're responsible for your success. Your support team will be here to guide, encourage, facilitate, and provide feedback, but it's up to you to put in the effort.

Reassure yourself during times of frustration that you are improving and learning. Remind yourself of the big picture, why you’re in the program, and that it’s hard work to learn new technologies and mindsets.

## Put In the Time
Be ready to spend time practicing to hone your craft. Think of this time as an investment in yourself, and know that for every hour you spend, you're securing yourself better opportunities for the future. Create a schedule and action plan to when and where you will do your challenge assignments and projects. Find a quiet space to work and join live classes. Remember to take breaks and get plenty of rest during your down time.

## Refine the Art of Using Google
Web development relies not on memorization but rather on the curation of bits and pieces of knowledge in various documentation, forums, and websites. It also requires the ability to quickly research solutions to problems you're working on. As you move into a more specialized area of web development, these skills become even more important. Remember, Google is an invaluable resource!

## Make a Plan
The online materials for the modules in Bootcamp Spot open each Sunday for your review. This is a great time to take a look at the weekly Challenge requirements and make a plan for the week. Assignments are due by 11:59 university time on Sunday, right before the next module opens up.

## Prioritize Self-Care
This course will require you to spend hours on hours in front of a computer. Put together an ergonomic setup for your computer station, check your posture often, and make sure you're breathing! It's important to take breaks and move your body at regular intervals, even if that means just stretching your upper body at your desk. In addition, make sure that you get enough rest in your free time. Connect with your support community to develop a strong network of developer support.
