To participate in this course, you need to know a few basic things about Bootcamp Spot, the learning platform you'll be using. You'll learn more about this system as you progress through the course, and you can always consult the official documentation for more information.

## Navigate Bootcamp Spot
Bootcamp Spot navigation consists of global navigation, course navigation, and module navigation.

* You can use **course navigation** to move between the different areas of your course, like Syllabus, Modules, Grades, and People. Course navigation is located just to the right of the global navigation and can be collapsed for more screen space, as shown in the following image:
