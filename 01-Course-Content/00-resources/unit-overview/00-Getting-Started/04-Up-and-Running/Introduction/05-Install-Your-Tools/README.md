# 0.4.6 Install Your Tools
Throughout this course, you'll be asked to install tools and sign up for services at the beginning of a module or even while working on it. However, you'll need to set up a few things now if you didn’t complete prework. Make sure to install all of these before you start Module 01.

## Ready for Action
We highly encourage you to complete the prework modules to install all of the tools required for Day 1 of class. Additionally, the activities in the prework are designed to introduce you or act as a refresher to equip you with the skills to succeed starting Day 1.

You should install the following tools before your first class to ensure that you're ready to go on Day 1:

* Google Chrome

* Visual Studio (VS) Code

* Open in Browser (VS Code extension)

* Git Bash (Windows only)

* Terminal (macOS only; preinstalled)

* Git and GitHub

* Xcode (macOS only)

* Homebrew (macOS only)

* SSH keys

## Quick Tips
* If you write directly to the files you pull from the class repo, you might end up with a few merge conflicts that result from overwriting your work with new updates. Feel free to make copies of files and store them in another folder so that you can work more freely.

* Make sure to save your username and password somewhere safe. GitLab password resets can take some time to process.
