# Module 01: HTML, CSS, and Git
**HTML**, or **Hypertext Markup Language**, is at the heart of every website. As the standard language used to build the structure of a webpage, HTML allows us to define elements like paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

**Cascading Style Sheets**, or **CSS**, is used to add styling to the elements created with HTML. CSS determines how elements are presented on the page, including font, color, size, positioning of elements, and even animation.

In this module, you'll learn how to build webpages that use HTML and CSS to define their structure and style. You'll also be introduced to Git, a version control system that stores your code and its history, as well as separate versions of the code. These building blocks of web development are essential skills and tools that you'll use throughout your career.
