## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development!

For this week's Challenge, you'll use your new HTML and CSS skills to ensure that an existing site is accessible, according to the provided guidelines.

Accessibility is an increasingly important consideration in web design. Inclusive design aims to ensure that all users—including those with disabilities—can interact with and understand the content of a webpage.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.
