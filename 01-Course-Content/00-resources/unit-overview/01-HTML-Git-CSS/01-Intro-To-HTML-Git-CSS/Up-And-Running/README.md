# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. You will be introduced to many such tools throughout the boot camp and will have ample chance to practice using them.

Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
In this module, you'll use the following tools:
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is the primary web browser you'll use to test and debug your project as you create it.

* **Chrome DevTools** is a set of web developer tools built directly into Google Chrome. These tools can help you edit pages on the fly and debug problems quickly.

* The **command line** allows you to set up projects and interact with your computer without using a graphical interface.

* **Git** is a system that allows you to create "save points" (called **commits**) of your work. It's good practice to commit your work whenever you reach a good stopping point. This creates a history of changes and allows you to revert to an earlier version if necessary.

* [Visual Studio (VS) Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free text editor that runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a free website that hosts Git repositories. It also allows developers to code collaboratively, and manages version control.

* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

If you completed the prework, these tools will already be installed. If you didn't, consult the prework to find installation instructions.

## How to Use Your Tools
Learning how to use your web development tools effectively can take time. Try to be patient with yourself, and refer to the following useful resources for extra guidance.

## Git Guide

## Bonus Resources
Refer to these resources for supplemental information about topics covered in this module.

* [ðŸ“– GitLab Docs on adding an SSH key to your GitLab account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#add-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account)

```
The SSH key you added for GitHub uses RSA. In the first step of the GitLab Docs instructions, it's very important to replace ED25519 with rsa.
