## Your Career Services Supports
We are here to support your career pursuits! Through career services, you have access to the following supports.

### CEN Plus
In addition to the Career Connection lessons throughout the boot camp, we have an entire course, called [CEN Plus](https://rise.articulate.com/share/yjD-ZcVvblNcNYCokY38pBUPng9TlATT#/), which is dedicated to career success. CEN Plus is a self-guided course that covers resume writing, portfolios, professional branding, using LinkedIn, networking, job searching, interviewing, and salary negotiation. It has persona-based resources, so you’ll find unique insights whether you identify as a career starter, a switcher, or an advancer. We’ll also share our industry insights and expertise throughout the course. You can access CEN Plus via the course portal.

### Career Material Advisors
You’ll be assigned a Career Material Advisor (CMA) once you submit your first milestone—likely your resume—for review. Once you’re assigned a CMA, they will continue to work with you for the duration of your program and beyond to help you get your application materials up to the mark! They typically provide feedback within seven business days and you can submit your materials for feedback as many times as you’d like. You can submit your materials by visiting the Career Services tab in the course portal.

### Career Coaches
You will have a Career Coach that you can meet with as many times as you want throughout the course, and for 90 days after the course concludes. Career Coaches can help you prepare for interviews, develop networking strategies, review application materials, and more. You will gain access to your Career Coach when your resume is approved by a CMA.

### Workshops and Events
We offer a variety of workshops and industry events designed to help you reach your goals, and connect with professionals in your industry. There are sessions for individuals who are advancing in their careers, as well as for individuals entering a new industry. All sessions are hosted virtually for your convenience, and they are free! Visit the [2U Career Engagement Network Events webpage](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/) to see upcoming events.

### Career Engagement Network
The Career Engagement Network is your online hub for all things career services. It includes a job board, sample application materials, the events calendar, and other resources. For more information, visit the [2U Career Engagement Network](https://careernetwork.2u.com/).

## Our Employer-ready Goal
Through conversations with thousands of employers, we understand what hiring managers are looking for. Our research has enabled us to develop a standard of job-applicant preparedness that we call becoming employer-ready (ER). We want to help you become employer-ready and gain your dream position.

### Employer-ready
Becoming employer-ready is a crucial first step on your journey to getting hired. The process includes creating a strong resume, GitHub portfolio, and online portfolio. We will work with you on all of these goals throughout this course. Once your resume is approved by a CMA according to our industry-backed standards, your Career Coach will connect with you to discuss and define your career goals and set the path for future success. For more information, visit the [Web Development section of the 2U Career Engagement Network](https://careernetwork.2u.com/tools-and-resources/#:~:text=Web-,Development,-Intro%20to%20Career) to explore specific employer-ready criteria.

### Getting Hired
Once you become employer-ready, we can work on additional steps to help you achieve your goals. We’ll teach you the importance of networking, strong interviewing, and building your brand and online presence. We have plenty of resources for you to use to become a more competitive job seeker. It is also important to note that success in your job search depends on your target role, your market, and most importantly, YOU. We are here to amplify your efforts, not replace them.

Speaking of career prep, we want to give you a sneak peak of what is to come in future Career Connections. One of our favorite sections of the weekly Career Connections is the Interview Prep pulldown menu. Click below to check it out!

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### It is common in the tech industry to have a technical interview as part of the hiring process. In this section of each Career Connection, we will review sample interview questions, and provide example responses. We’ve included this section as a pulldown feature so that you can practice as you go through the course, or skip these sections now and come back later when you are preparing for interviews.

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 1 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/pqVKbWpaowpiA2g4A) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the following Let's Code video for tips and tricks on how to best solve algorithm problems: [The 10 Most Important Concepts For Coding Interviews (algorithms and data structures)
