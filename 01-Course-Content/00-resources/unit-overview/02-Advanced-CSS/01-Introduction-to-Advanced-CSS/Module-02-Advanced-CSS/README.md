# Module 02: Advanced CSS
More and more users are browsing the web from a mobile device—causing developers to change how they think about layout and design. Advanced CSS features like media queries and flexbox make it easier to accommodate multiple screen sizes and to build apps with a mobile-first mindset. Similarly, website design has evolved to include many niceties that users now take for granted, such as animated hover effects, rounded corners, and shadows. In the old days of the web, these tricks would have required some complex workarounds or even JavaScript, but newer CSS properties have simplified their implementation.

In this module, you'll learn how to build web apps that incorporate both responsive web design and advanced CSS. These skills are a must for modern web developers, and learning them will enable you to create attractive, engaging, and adaptive websites.
