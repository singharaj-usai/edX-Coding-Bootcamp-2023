# 02.2 CSS Resets, Pseudo-Classes, and Pseudo-Elements
The theme of this lesson is overwriting CSS browser defaults. You'll implement a CSS reset to zero-out certain styles, then you'll rebuild those styles using advanced CSS concepts like pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Explain why you would use a CSS reset.

* Add pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to HTML elements.

* Explain the default styles that browsers apply to form elements.
