## CSS in the Workplace
Something that may excite you about CSS is how it brings a design component into web development. Using CSS, we can add text styles, layouts, and effects to our web content. If you feel pressured to choose between designing and engineering, then roles in which you design via CSS could be for you.

Typically, people that work with CSS have a breadth of programming knowledge. In addition to CSS, they use HTML, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies. It would be hard to find a "CSS Developer" role because CSS is just a small part of front-end development. Instead, roles like "Web Developer/Designer" or "Front-end Developer/Designer" would be a good place to start for those interested in working with CSS.

CSS has come a long way since its launch in 1994. You may be interested in exploring some of the innovations so that you can apply them to your work. The [MDN Web Docs on CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is a good place to start this exploration. CSS variables, pseudo-classes, and scroll snap are especially notable upgrades that make CSS a favorite among programmers.

## Finding Your Career Fit: Discover Your Career Goals
![](../../../images/coding-career-connection-research.png)

The "Finding Your Career Fit" section of each Career Connection will equip you with the skills and knowledge to find your fit in the world of web development. We will start with the research phase, where we reflect on what we are looking for in a career and begin to research opportunities. Then we will discuss networking, application materials, interviews, job offers, and life in your new career.

Today, we want to look at the big picture. Why are you here? What is your next career move? Take the three small steps below to finetune your answers to these questions.

### Step 1: Become a part of the tech community
This first tip is extremely valuable. Becoming a part of the tech community will enhance your ability to direct your career path successfully, and enable you to build connections with professionals. Do the following today:

* Follow 2–3 tech companies on social media

* Subscribe to a tech blog or email listserv

* Connect with 2–3 tech professionals on LinkedIn

* BONUS: Opt-in to job alerts for relevant positions on your preferred job site

### Step 2: Reflect on your motivations and interests
Understanding your motivations and interests ensures that your career pursuits take you in the right direction. Take some time to answer the following questions. Your answers to these questions will become the springboard from which you launch your career search:

* What am I looking for in a career?

* Why is web development the right fit for me?

* What projects and teams do I enjoy working with?

* How do my values and interests need to align with my career?

### Step 3: Explore careers in web development
The world of programming exploded after the invention of the internet, which led to the creation of several career paths. Today, people who love to code can be front-end developers, back-end developers, full-stack developers, software engineers, and more. It is going to take some research to find the job positions that interest you the most. Let’s start this exploration this week, by following these steps:

* Visit [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/), or your favorite employment-oriented website, and search for jobs in the coding industry, such as "front-end developer," "back-end developer," "full-stack developer," and "software engineer."

* Once you’ve found a few job postings, read through each post and reflect on how it matches your values, interests, and goals from Step 2.

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### It is common in the tech industry to have a technical interview as part of the hiring process. In this section of each Career Connection, we will review sample interview questions, and provide example responses. We’ve included this section as a pulldown feature so that you can practice as you go through the course, or skip these sections now and come back later when you are preparing for interviews.

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 2 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/72YzfNppttviTD8a6) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the following Let's Code video for tips and tricks on how to best solve algorithm problems: [The 10 Most Important Concepts For Coding Interviews (algorithms and data structures)
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge0Udbws1kc)

### Next Steps
Each week, we will provide a list of steps that will help you in your career pursuits, and get you closer to meeting the employer-ready criteria. This week’s steps are the following:

* Consider adding CSS, HTML, and Git to the technical skills section of your application materials.

* In your course portal, select the Career Services tab, and then explore the material-submission assignments.

* Connect with tech companies and professionals on social media.
