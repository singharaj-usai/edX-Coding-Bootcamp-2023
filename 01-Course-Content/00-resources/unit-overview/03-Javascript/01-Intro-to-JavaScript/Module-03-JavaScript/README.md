# Module 03: JavaScript
We've already explored how to structure webpages using HTML and style them using CSS. Now, with the help of JavaScript, we'll learn how to make webpages dynamic.

**JavaScript** is a widely used scripting language that adds functionality and interactivity to a webpage. Building on a static HTML framework and CSS styling, using JavaScript you can store information in variables, manipulate your HTML, respond to an event, play audio and video, add decision-making to your code, and do much more.

As the only programming language native to web browsers, JavaScript is used all over the web—making it a crucial skill in your toolbox. But Javascript development skills are also versatile. Once you have mastered JavaScript, it is much easier to learn the fundamentals of other programming languages.
