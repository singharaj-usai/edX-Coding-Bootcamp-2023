## Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Implement complex decision-making in your code using **if** and **if-else** statements.

* Explain the difference between equality **(==)** and strict equality **(===)**.

* Store related data in an array, and use array methods to mutate and perform operations on the array.

* Explain functions and how they are used in JavaScript.

* Explain the difference between function declarations and function expressions.

* Recognize whether a variable is locally or globally scoped, and explain the difference.

* Create objects and use object methods.

* Use the keyword **var** to declare a variable.

## Career Connection
Wow. This module was a game-changer! You learned JavaScript! JavaScript opens the door to a plethora of opportunities. Today, we will discuss the significance of JavaScript in the workplace, and some career pathways in the world of web development.

### Today’s Career Connection Agenda

* JavaScript in the Workplace

* Finding Your Career Fit: Exploring Careers in Tech

* Interview Prep

* Next Steps

### JavaScript in the Workplace
We really can’t exaggerate how important JavaScript is in web development. A [W3Tech survey](https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/client_side_language/all) reports that 97% of websites are built with JavaScript. No matter which web development role you pursue, you will probably encounter JavaScript. One reason for this is the fact that JavaScript is used for both front-end and back-end web development. Let’s talk more about these two use cases.

### JavaScript for Front-end Development
This is where JavaScript shines. JavaScript was originally invented for the purpose of bringing webpages to life. Front-end developers use JavaScript to add animations and interaction to webpages. There are hundreds of front-end technologies that are built on top of JavaScript, but the most popular are React, Vue, and Angular. (We will learn React later in the course.)

### JavaScript for Back-end Development
The development of Node.js in 2009 promoted the use of JavaScript as a back-end language. Node.js (which we will learn in this course) enables developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. Developers enjoy using Node.js for back-end development because it is concise, fast, and easy to learn. In case you are curious, other back-end languages include Python, PHP, Java, and Ruby.

As you can see, whether you enjoy front-end or back-end development, you will likely find yourself using JavaScript in your career. In this course, we will continue building your JavaScript toolbox so that you are ready to tackle the challenges of your next career move.

## Finding Your Career Fit: Exploring Careers in Tech
![](../../../images/coding-career-connection-research.png)

You chose a great field for your next career move (although, we may be a bit biased). [According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm), employment of web developers is projected to grow by 13% from 2020 to 2030. That is fast! Today we want to discuss some of the career opportunities available to you in this growing field.

Below is a list of job titles that are common in the world of web development. We recommend reading through the list and researching any titles that interest you. (Note: You may not be qualified for all of these positions after the boot camp, but we want to show you what the world of web development has to offer.)

* **App Developer**: Develop applications

* **Back-end Web Developer**: Design and build the back-ends of websites and applications

* **Blockchain Developer**: Develop blockchain technologies

* **Coding Instructor**: Teach coding curriculum

* **Digital Consultant**: Help businesses connect their strategy to digital implementation

* **Front-end Web Developer**: Design and build the front end of websites and applications

* **Full-Stack Web Developer**: Work on both front-end and back-end development

* **Game Developer**: Produce games for computers, game consoles, and handheld devices

* **Multimedia Programmer**: Design and develop multimedia computer products

* **Product Manager**: Oversee the progress of product development

* **SEO Specialist**: Implement search engine optimization strategies

* **Software Architect**: Make high-level design choices and enforce technical standards

* **Software Engineer**: Design and build computer software

* **Technical Project Manager**: Oversee project from start to finish

* **UX Designer**: Enhance the user experience of websites and applications

* **Web Content Manager**: Manage website content and operations

Do you have a different job title in mind? Great! Web development is a place for innovation. New job titles are common in the field (for example, Blockchain Developer is a relatively new title), and there is definitely space for you to create your own fit.

One more thing! We recommend that you check out a phenomenal resource that we have created for you on the Career Engagement Network, the [Career Pathways: Web Development](https://careernetwork.2u.com/career-pathways/web-development/) page. This resource contains information on certifications, in-demand skills, trends in the market, and job descriptions.

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### It is common in the tech industry to have a technical interview as part of the hiring process. In this section of each Career Connection, we will review sample interview questions, and provide example responses. We’ve included this section as a pulldown feature so that you can practice as you go through the course, or skip these sections now and come back later when you are preparing for interviews.

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 3 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/WQNAEujgFBVm6kc796) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. Starting this week, we will provide weekly algorithm problems for you to work on.

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Spend up to a few hours trying to solve each problem without looking at the solution. If you're unable to solve a problem, study the solution to understand why it works and then come back and try again later:

* [01: Arithmetic](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/03-JavaScript/01-arithmetic.zip)

* [02: Odd or Even](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/03-JavaScript/02-odd-or-even.zip)

* [03: Log Nums](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/03-JavaScript/03-log-nums.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Odd or Even problem:

### Next Steps
* Consider adding JavaScript to the technical skills section of your application materials.

* Research job titles in the tech industry that interest you.

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

Next week, you'll learn to harness the power of Web APIs to add complex functionality to your JavaScript with just a few lines of code.
