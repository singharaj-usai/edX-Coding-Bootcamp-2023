# Module 04: Web APIs
This week, you'll learn about **application programming interfaces**, or **APIs**, which allow web developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications. An essential part of a developer's toolbox, APIs can help add a wide range of functionality to your code.

APIs are built directly into the browser. When a webpage is loaded in the browser, an object representation of the webpage (the **Document Object Model**, or **DOM**) is created. As a programming interface, the DOM allows us to use JavaScript to interact with HTML elements.

During class and in this week's Challenge, you'll practice navigating the DOM. You'll also learn how to create and manipulate HTML elements, add event listeners, create timers, and store data—all using the power of JavaScript and an API built into the browser itself.
