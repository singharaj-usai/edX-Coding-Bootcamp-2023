# 04.1 Introduction to Web APIs
This class introduces the Document Object Model. You'll gain experience using Web APIs to create, get, and append elements. You'll also learn to set attributes and work with timers while reinforcing your existing JavaScript skills.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Inspect the **Window** object.

* Traverse the DOM using various Web APIs.

* Query the DOM for elements by their selector.

* Add styles to specific elements using **setAttribute()**.

* Create and append elements to the document.

* Implement timers using **setInterval()** and **clearInterval()**.
