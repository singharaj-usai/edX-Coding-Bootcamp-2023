# Module 05: Third-Party APIs
When developers find themselves repeating a task, they tend to look for a way to simplify their workflow. We've already learned how CSS frameworks were developed to ensure consistency across applications and to expedite developer workflows; tools with similar goals have emerged in the JavaScript ecosystem.

jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling. It allows us to write fewer lines of code than if we were using plain old JavaScript. jQuery also provides a number of methods for animations and working with APIs.

Some developers might point out that jQuery is slowly being phased out and replaced with front-end frameworks such as React. It's true that you might not see as many job listings for jQuery developers specifically, but the library is still widely used in both new and legacy code—so it's an important skill to acquire.
