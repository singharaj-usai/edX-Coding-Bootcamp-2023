# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module—and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Explain and implement CDNs to leverage third-party APIs like CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, and custom fonts.

* Use jQuery to perform DOM manipulation and traversals and implement interactivity using event handlers.

* Explain how to resolve issues related to dynamically generated HTML using jQuery.

* Explain and implement the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML.

* Integrate Bootstrap components in HTML files to quickly build user interfaces.

* Add custom styling to a CSS framework.

* Implement jQuery UI to make a webpage more user-friendly.

* Use Moment.js to format dates and calculate time differences.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

* [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/)
    * [DOM traversal and manipulation](https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/)
    * [Event handling](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/)

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/demos/)

* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/)

**NOTE**
```
Moment.js has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers. We will still cover it in this module, but you can refer to the resources listed in Up and Running for alternatives.
```
## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development!

For this week's Challenge, you'll create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by jQuery.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
