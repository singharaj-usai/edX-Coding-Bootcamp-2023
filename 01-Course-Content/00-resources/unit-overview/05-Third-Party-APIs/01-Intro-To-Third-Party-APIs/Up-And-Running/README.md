# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
For the following tools, you don't need to install anythingâ€”just check that you can access them.

In this module, you'll use the following tools:

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is the most popular JavaScript library in the world. It simplifies DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation with an easy-to-use API.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) is an open source responsive front-end component library for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. It uses a responsive grid system to allow for quick layouts in both development and production.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a library of over 900 free licensed fonts, with an API for conveniently adding the fonts to your web application.

* [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) is a set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery library, providing features such as drag-and-drop functionality and a date picker.

* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) is an open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object directly, making the Date object easier to parse, validate, and display.
