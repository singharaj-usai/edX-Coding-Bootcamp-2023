# 05.1 Introduction to jQuery
In this class, you'll perform DOM manipulations again, but this time you'll be using jQuery, using the equivalent strategy of traversing down the DOM tree through child elements from the parent element.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Create and select DOM elements.

* Assign content or styling to a DOM element.

* Append, prepend, and replace elements to the DOM.

* Traverse the DOM through child elements.

* Attach event listeners and their corresponding event handling functionality.

* Delegate events for elements that have been dynamically created.
