# Module 06: Server-Side APIs
In a full-stack application, the client (in other words, the front end) makes requests to the server (the back end) to get data to display to the user. One way the client can request this data is by using the Fetch Web API. The Fetch API can even request data from third-party APIs, like the OpenWeather API.

In this module, we'll use the **fetch()** method to make requests, parse through the returned datasets, and convert them to HTML elements. We'll explore how this data is typically formatted, how to find and handle errors that might arise, and more importantly, how to read documentation when working with server-side APIs.
