# 06.3 Fetch API Review and Git Collaboration
In this lesson, you'll review topics you've learned throughout the course so far to help prepare you for the mini-project and Challenge. You'll also learn how to set up a GitHub repository for collaboration and how to collaborate with others on an application. The purpose of this lesson is to show you how everything you've learned is used in a slightly bigger application.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Reverse-engineer and learn from reviewing larger applications.

* Set up your GitHub repositories for a collaborative environment.

* Successfully collaborate with others in a single GitHub repository.

* Build a larger-scale application that uses all your previously learned skills.
