# Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Explain what JSON is.

* Explain the methods that can be used to request data from the server.

* Explain the difference between a client-side and server-side API.

* Explain the client-server model and request-response pattern.

* Implement and explain the differences between making HTTP GET requests with XMLHttpRequest, jQuery AJAX, and the Fetch API.

* Explain HTTP response codes and handle response metadata with the Fetch API.

* Parse JSON to dynamically generate HTML.

* Explain the benefits and challenges of working with asynchronous JavaScript.

* Explain and implement URL query string parameters.

## Career Connection
Whoa, that was an intense week of material, right? This is where things get really exciting! Now, instead of only making websites with content that you wrote yourself, you can build fully functional web applications by pulling in data from different providers.

### Today’s Career Connection Agenda
* Server-side APIs in the Workplace

* Finding Your Career Fit: Networking

* Interview Prep

* Next Steps

### Server-side APIs in the Workplace
Many companies opt for using server-side APIs, which you now know are APIs that power an integration with an app or web service from another business. There are many advantages to working with server-side APIs, but, as with all technologies, there are downsides as well. Let’s discuss some of the benefits and obstacles that you may encounter while working with server-side APIs.

#### Server-side API Benefits
The main benefit to server-side APIs is that they enable companies to utilize services without developing them. Thus, server-side APIs save companies time and money, and enable them to deploy new services quickly. Companies also benefit from the work that the server-side puts into the API, which may include user research, developer updates, or security practices. As a developer, this all means that you get to focus on the fun work of developing your product!

#### Server-side API Obstacles
So what may be some of your concerns regarding server-side APIs? First of all, they can be expensive. It is important for companies to compare the value that the API provides with the cost to develop it in-house. Another concern is the latency or uptime of the server-side API. If a provider has an issue, your product will be impacted by it, but there is little that you can do as a developer to fix it. This is why it is wise to choose server-side API providers that have strong products that have been tested by many users and which also offer a help team.

Also, we’d like to leave one more note for students that will be applying for jobs after this course. This week’s skills give you the opportunity to make your online portfolio even more impressive. With your new skills, you can incorporate external data into your existing online portfolio, like displaying today’s weather. Why not take it a step further? You could build a dynamic weather app into your portfolio that uses browser API to get the user’s location, and then makes a request to an external API to display the weather. Be sure to document personal projects like this to your GitHub page, and write a fully formed README file.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Networking
![](../../../images/coding-career-connection-network.png)

Job seekers who use networking strategies get hired more quickly than those who don’t, which makes networking an essential piece of your job search. Luckily for you, Career Services provides several resources to help you get networking:
* [Networking Guide](https://careernetwork.2u.com/articles/networking-guide/)

* [Networking Email & Message Templates](https://careernetwork.2u.com/articles/outreach-templates-resources/)

(Definitely check this one out!)
* [One Epic Networking Session Workshop](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/#upcoming)

* [CEN Plus - Networking Module](https://bit.ly/CENPlus)

We know that networking can be uncomfortable. Many prefer to search for jobs and apply online. However, this strategy means that you are working harder, not smarter. Talking with professionals, family, and friends is the best way to hear about new job opportunities and get an employee referral that will put you on the top of the resume stack.

One of the easiest ways to build your network is to start connecting with your Career Coach. Submit your resume via the Career Services tab in the course portal to unlock your Career Coach connection.

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 6 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/xcqMRiysBemJpvz78) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. Starting this week, we will provide weekly algorithm problems for you to work on.

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [01: Is Palindrome](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/06-Server-Side-APIs/01-is-palindrome.zip)

* [02: Factorial](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/06-Server-Side-APIs/02-factorial.zip)

* [03: Title Case](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/06-Server-Side-APIs/03-title-case.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Factorial problem:

Also, here is a problem for you to try on CodeSignal: [Array Median](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/KXE5b7L3CPKSdYkzh/35X8aLqz9hNStg)

### Next Steps
* Consider adding APIs to the technical skills sections of your application materials. (Only add APIs that you have experience with, and that relate to the positions you are applying for.)

* Consider adding AJAX to the technical skills section of your application materials.

* It’s never too early to start networking! Reach out to at least one person in your network to update them on your job search or to learn more about the field of web development.

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

Get ready for your first group project! In the next module, you and your teammates will use all of your new skills to build an app of your choosing.
