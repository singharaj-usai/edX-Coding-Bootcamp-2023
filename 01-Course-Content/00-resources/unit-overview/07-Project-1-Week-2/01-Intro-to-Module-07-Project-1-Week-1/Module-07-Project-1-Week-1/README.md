# Module 07: Project 1 Week 1
Welcome to your first group project! This is an important step in your full-stack journey, as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

Because you'll be working collaboratively, you'll learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.
