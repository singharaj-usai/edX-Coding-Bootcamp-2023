## Career Connection
Welcome back! We hope that you are enjoying your second week of your first project. Today, we will talk about a project management methodology called agile, and discuss how to build an effective LinkedIn profile.

### Today’s Career Connection Agenda
* Agile in the Workplace

* Finding Your Career Fit: Creating an Effective LinkedIn Profile

* Next Steps

### Agile in the Workplace
Throughout Project 1, we encouraged you to use an iterative approach to project management, called agile. Agile got its start in the world of software development, but has since exploded, as described in this [State of Agile report from Digital AI](https://digital.ai/resource-center/analyst-reports/state-of-agile-report), 81% of agile users report using a scrum-derived methodology. Typically, scrum involves daily team standups, project retrospectives, and sprint planning.

So what does this mean for you? If you are an entrepreneur or a manager, consider bringing agile and scrum into your workflow. Companies have stated that it enables them to manage changing priorities, accelerate software delivery, and increase team productivity. If you are job seeking, we recommend familiarizing yourself with agile methodologies since it is likely to come up in the interview process.

Also, if you are especially passionate about agile and scrum, you may consider pursuing an agile certification or becoming a Certified ScrumMaster. If relevant to your career pursuits, these certifications can boost your value to companies.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Creating an Effective LinkedIn Profile

We talked to a director at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), and they really grabbed our attention with one insight. Instead of thinking of LinkedIn as a stack of professional portfolios, they encouraged us to think of it as a career landing page where the SEO is done for you. Let’s break this down.

LinkedIn is a dynamic website that uses algorithms to help employers find you, and help you find employers. When you create a profile on LinkedIn, you are creating an opportunity to connect with 810+ million people and 55+ million companies. How can you ensure that the algorithm connects you with the right people? Here are a few tips:

### Create an engaging job title
When employers and recruiters are searching for candidates on LinkedIn they will see your name and job title in large font. Seize this opportunity by creating an engaging job title with attractive keywords. For example, **Software Engineer | Visionary Technologist | Certified ScrumMaster**.

### Use keywords in your profile
Fill your profile with keywords that are relevant to your job search. For example, if you want a position where you get to be creative, use the word creative in your job title or personal summary. When an employer searches for "Creative (insert job title)," they may find you!

### Expand your network
LinkedIn search results heavily depend on the searcher’s network. People that the searcher is connected with will show up higher on the list than others. Furthermore, friends of the people that the searcher knows with rank higher as well. So cast your net wide! Start connecting with friends, family, and professionals.
