# Module 09: Node.js
You’ve arrived at another important milestone in your journey! The JavaScript you wrote for your first project was executed entirely on the client side, though it used third-party server-side APIs. In this and later modules, you’ll learn how to write your own server-side applications to handle requests and ultimately to build your own APIs.

In a previous era, this would be the point when you’d begin learning a second programming language, like PHP, to write server-side code. Luckily, Node.js—released in 2009—makes this unnecessary. Node.js is an implementation of the V8 JavaScript engine without Chrome. It allows you to write server-side code using JavaScript. This means that you no longer need a browser to run JavaScript. You can (and will) do so from the command line!

In this module, you’ll learn how to initialize a Node.js project, install third-party dependencies, and create interactive command-line applications. Node.js ships with a **standard library**. The standard library contains a number of modules that allow you to extend the functionality of Node.js, like fs, which you’ll use to read and write files. You’ll also learn how to add a large and robust ecosystem of third-party modules to applications to extend their functionality.
