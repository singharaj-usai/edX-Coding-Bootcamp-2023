# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
For Node.js and npm, please follow the installation instructions outlined here. For all other tools, check that you can access them.

In this module, you'll use the following tools:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an asynchronous JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. This allows developers to code the back ends of their applications using JavaScript instead of another programming language. Node.js runs scripts on the server side to produce dynamic webpage content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), or Node package manager, is the default package manager for Node.js. It is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, npm is automatically installed on your computer! You will use npm from the command line to add Node.js packages (such as Inquirer) to your applications. Each package adds additional functionality that you can include by passing it as an argument to the require function.

* [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) is an embeddable command-line interface for Node.js that makes it easy to ask questions, validate answers, parse input, provide error feedback, and manage hierarchical prompts. It allows you to create interactive menus in your command-line interface applications.

**NOTE**: 
You'll use a specific version of **inquirer** for this module: **8.2.4**.

To install Node.js and npm on your computer, refer to [The Full-Stack Blog guide to installing Node.js](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).
