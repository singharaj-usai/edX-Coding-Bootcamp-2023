# 09.1 Introduction to Node.js and ES6
This lesson introduces Node.js and the new syntax that comes with ES6, including arrow functions and new variables **let** and **const**. You'll also learn about template literals and how they can be helpful in the development process.

**IMPORTANT** 
> All activities using the inquirer package will need to use version 8.2.4. The latest version of inquirer (version 9+) introduces breaking changes to activities. All activities have version 8.2.4 in their respective package.json files but should you install inquirer, please use npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Explain the client-server model.

* Run very simple JavaScript files from the command line using Node.js.

* Explain arrow functions and how they impact the **this** context.

* Use template strings and use **const** and **let** in place of **var**.

* Use functional loops like **map()** and **filter()**.
