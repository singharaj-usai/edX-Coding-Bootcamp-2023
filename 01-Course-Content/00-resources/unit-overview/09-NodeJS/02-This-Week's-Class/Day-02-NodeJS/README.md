# 09.2 Node.js
In this lesson, you'll delve further into Node.js. You'll explore how to take advantage of native modules that come built into Node.js itself. You'll access the file system, pass command-line arguments into applications, get acquainted with Node package manager, and finally build CLI apps using a package called **inquirer**.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Run Node.js applications from the command line using arguments.

* Import and use the native **fs** module to read and write to the file system.

* Initialize projects and install third-party modules like **inquirer** using npm.

Use dependencies and investigate the content of **package.json**.
