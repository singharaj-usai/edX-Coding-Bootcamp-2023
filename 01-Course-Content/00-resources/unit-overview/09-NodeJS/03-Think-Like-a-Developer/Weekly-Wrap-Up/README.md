# Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Build interactive command-line applications that process user input.

* Explain modularization and how it relates to npm and the standard library.

* Initialize new Node.js projects with npm, and install and import dependencies.

* Explain the importance and usefulness of ES6+ concepts such as **let**, **const**, and arrow functions.

* Handle asynchronicity with callbacks and Promises.

## Career Connection
This week you jumped into Node.js and got your first taste of back-end development! Let’s talk about Node.js in the workplace, and discuss how telling your programming story can help you stand out in an interview.

* Next Steps

### Node.js in the Workplace
Since its invention in 2009, Node.js has become extremely popular. According to the [StackOverflow 2021 State of Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021?_ga=2.249938502.1366544617.1642106885-855637217.1642106885#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages), Node.js is the most popular non-language, non-database development tool. Its speed, low cost, and scalability led large tech companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and eBay to adopt it into their applications. An interesting side effect of this adoption has been the blurring of the lines between traditional developer roles.

You see, traditionally front-end and back-end developers used different programming languages—a company may have been using JavaScript on the front end and PHP on the back end. Then Node.js entered and enabled JavaScript developers to work across the two sides. Thus, it is now likely that you will see front-end developers using Node.js to quickly develop a server-side application, even if they have little experience with back-end development principles. Alternatively, back-end developers who are working with Node.js are able to more effectively communicate with front-end development and review front-end code. You might also see companies taking advantage of this cross-platform JavaScript expertise usage by pulling talent from the front-end team onto the back-end team, and vice versa.

Finally, full-stack developer roles were also impacted by Node.js, in that they can now use one programming language for all of their programming responsibilities. This increases development efficiency, enables full-stack developers to reuse code, and enables products to scale more smoothly. It also enables prospective full-stack developers (perhaps you are one of them?) to find a career fit by gaining a deep understanding of JavaScript, instead of learning multiple programming languages.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Telling Your Story

![](../../../images/coding-career-application-materials.png)

The most popular interview question is "Tell me about yourself." Why? Because employers want to hear your story! They want to hear how you define yourself, and how you came to be the skilled, capable person that you are. So how will you answer this question? This is where storytelling comes in.

"…a key aspect of success in your application is confidence. In a job interview, the person sitting across from you is trying to project what it will be like to work with you. Your confidence in answering questions is a big part of these judgments." - [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2018/04/stay-confident-during-your-job-search-by-focusing-on-the-process-not-the-outcome)

Rather than presenting yourself as a list of skills, storytelling involves creating a full picture of your value as an employee. An effective story will make you more memorable, emphasize your strengths, and help you connect with interviewers.

Here are some of our tips for successful career storytelling:

### Choose a starting point
Your starting point should be the big "a-ha moment" that launched your current career path. This could be a childhood event, your first success, a life transition, or a notable inspiration, such as a mentor or professional.

Example: "I attended my first hackathon in 2018, and fell in love with the innovative energy. It is what led me to complete a full-stack bootcamp, and eventually host my own local hackathon."

### Be the hero
Interviews are time for you to shine. So, position yourself as the hero in your story. Your goal is to inspire the interviewer with your story, and compel them to hire your unique talent and skills.

### Prioritize in-demand skills
Similar to using keywords in your resume, you want to highlight in-demand skills in your story. You can do this with technical skills and soft skills. For example, if you know that the company is looking for creative problem-solvers, be sure to highlight your creative problem-solving skills in your story.

### Be consistent throughout application materials
Help your story stay strong in a recruiter’s mind by keeping your story consistent throughout your application materials. This includes your resume, cover letter, portfolio, LinkedIn, and interview.

Creating an effective story will take a bit of time, but we think it is well worth it because it enables you to control your narrative. Remember, you do not want to be a cookie cutter applicant. You want to stand-out as the BEST applicant. So grab a pen, journal, and beverage, and get story writing!

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 9 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/VKfsdSySYgc4Hrih7) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. Starting this week, we will provide weekly algorithm problems for you to work on.

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [02: Product of Largest Two](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/09-NodeJS/02-product-of-largest-two.zip)

* [03: Camel Case](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/09-NodeJS/03-camel-case.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Character Count problem:

### Next Steps
* Consider adding Node.js to the technical skills section of your resume.

* Create a professional story that you can use to introduce yourself professionally to interviewers and colleagues.

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

In the next module, you'll learn about **object-oriented programming**, or OOP—a topic that is very concept-heavy. It might seem difficult at first, but understanding it is important in becoming employer-competitive. Don't worry if you don't immediately understand it; it's perfectly normal to feel a little lost at first!
