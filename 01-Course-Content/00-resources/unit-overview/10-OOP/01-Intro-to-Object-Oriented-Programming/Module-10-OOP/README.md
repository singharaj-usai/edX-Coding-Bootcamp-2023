# Module 10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
In this module, we'll discuss object-oriented programming in JavaScript as we learn about constructors and the prototype chain. **Constructors** are special functions that help us create objects of similar types. **Prototypes** are JavaScript’s built-in system that allows objects to inherit features from other objects. Additionally, we'll explore Promises and learn how to take full advantage of them.

We'll also cover **test-driven development (TDD)**, which involves writing tests for application features before writing any code. Then we write only the minimum amount of code needed to make the tests pass—and repeat this process until the application is complete. Among its many benefits, test-driven development helps us write more understandable and maintainable code.

We'll conclude this module with an introduction to modern class syntax and inheritance. ES6 introduced a **class** keyword, which allows us to create objects that use class structures like those found in other OOP languages. Essentially, classes are just constructor functions with more intuitive syntax. They allow us to implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance, without needing to understand every aspect of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance system.
