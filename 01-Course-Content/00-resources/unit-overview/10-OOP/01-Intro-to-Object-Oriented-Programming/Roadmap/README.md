# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.

* Create new objects using constructor functions.

* Add methods to objects using prototypal inheritance.

* Explain polymorphism through method overloading.

* Implement Promise.all() to wait for multiple API calls.

* Verify that your code works as intended through the use of automated tests.

* Build applications using test-driven development—writing tests before implementing functionality.

* Implement ES6 classes to create new instances of objects.

* Extend basic classes with additional functionality.

* Implement multiple classes with different purposes to practice the OOP paradigm.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

For this week's Challenge, you'll create an application that generates HTML files using input from a command-line interface. The application will gather information about your team or organization, and you'll be able to add as many team members as you want.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
