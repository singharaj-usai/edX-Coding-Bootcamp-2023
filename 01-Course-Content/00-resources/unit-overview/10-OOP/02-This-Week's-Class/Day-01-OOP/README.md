# 10.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
In this class, you'll be introduced to object-oriented programming. You'll learn about key OOP concepts like constructors, prototypes, polymorphism, and Promises.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Create new objects using constructor functions.

* Add methods to objects using prototypical inheritance.

* Explain polymorphism through method overloading.

* Implement **Promise.all()** to wait for multiple API calls.
