# Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.

* Create new objects using constructor functions.

* Add methods to objects using prototypal inheritance.

* Explain polymorphism through method overloading.

* Implement **Promise.all()** to wait for multiple API calls.

* Verify that your code works as intended through the use of automated tests.

* Build applications using test-driven development—writing tests before implementing functionality.

* Implement ES6 classes to create new instances of objects.

* Extend basic classes with additional functionality.

* Implement multiple classes with different purposes to practice the OOP paradigm.

## Career Connection
Congratulations on making it through your second week of back-end development! The concepts that you learned this week—object-oriented programming (OOP) and test-driven development (TDD)—are vital to your future programming career, and you will encounter them frequently during the interview process. For those considering junior developer roles, TDD is considered a core competency because testing is often a major part of the role.

## Object-oriented Programming in the Workplace
This week, you learned how to use JavaScript to implement object-oriented coding standards. However, the principles you learned don’t just apply to JavaScript—in fact, they are often more important when using other languages.

You see, JavaScript can be considered both an OOP language and a functional programming language. In other words, you can choose to write JavaScript without classes and inheritance (and other OOP functionalities). However, some languages are designed mainly for OOP, such as Ruby, C#, and Java.

So why bother with OOP if you are learning JavaScript? Well, even if you want a career in full-stack JavaScript development, other programming languages may be in higher demand or you may find that your dream position/company is using a different OOP programming language. By learning OOP principles with JavaScript, you have made a transition to languages that use class-based OOP much easier.

On that note, we love looking at the [Stack Overflow State of Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021?_ga=2.249938502.1366544617.1642106885-855637217.1642106885#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) to get an idea of what the future of development holds. Specifically, look at the data on top paying technologies, the love-dreaded chart, and the wanted chart. These charts will help you understand the demand for certain technologies, and if you want to pursue them in your career.

Finding Your Career Fit: Writing an Engaging Personal Brand Statement

![](../../../unit-overview/images/coding-career-application-materials.png)

Last week, we discussed how storytelling can help you stand out in the hiring process. Today let’s review a powerful storytelling tool, the personal brand statement.

A personal brand statement is a 1-5 sentence paragraph that sums up your experience, skills, and passion. It is usually placed at the top of a resume, portfolio, or profile, and is thus the first impression that a potential employer has of the candidate. Therefore, your brand statement should be a glowing summary of your value as an employee.

Let’s look at an example. Following is a resume brand statement for an entry-level web development professional:

Front-end web developer leveraging background in psychology to build more intuitive user experiences on the web. Recently earned a certificate in full-stack development from [school name] and developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. Known as an innovative problem-solver who is passionate about developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design and development.

That brand statement was only three sentences, and it told us so much about the applicant! We know that they have a psychology background, excel at user experience design, and are proficient in JavaScript, CSS, and React.js. This applicant has given us a glowing overview of their value as an employee. Now it’s your turn to do the same.

Here are a few resources that we have created to help you develop your brand statement:

* [Brand Statement Guide](https://careernetwork.2u.com/articles/ec-checklist-guide-brand-statement/)

* [Brand Statement Samples](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rNRauHkGgucM9bSeC0gO-txaKuQlSu_x/view)

* [Web Development Brand Statement Samples](https://careernetwork.2u.com/articles/web-development-brand-statement-samples/)

Also, don’t forget that you can send your brand statement to a Career Material Advisor for review. Do this via the Career Services tab in the course portal.

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 10 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/rDcYU44xb23s5jm59) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. Starting this week, we will provide weekly algorithm problems for you to work on.

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [01: Linear Search](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/10-OOP/01-linear-search.zip)

* [02: Is Unique](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/10-OOP/02-is-unique.zip)

* [03: Is Anagram](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/10-OOP/03-is-anagram.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Is Anagram problem:

### Next Steps
* Create a brand statement, and add it to the top of your resume and LinkedIn profile.

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

Next week, you'll start using Heroku to host your web applications. Be sure to have the Heroku CLI installed on your computer BEFORE attending your classes. You can refer to the [Heroku CLI installation guide on the Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/how-to-install-the-heroku-cli) for extra guidance.

You'll also use an application called Insomnia to make requests to routes you create with Express.js. Be sure to install Insomnia on your computer BEFORE attending your classes. You can do that on the [Insomnia download page](https://insomnia.rest/download).
