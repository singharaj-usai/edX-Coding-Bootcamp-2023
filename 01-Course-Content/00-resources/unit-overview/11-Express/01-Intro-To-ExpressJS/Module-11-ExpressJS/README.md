# Module 11: Express.js
In this module, we'll use Express.js, a widely used Node.js framework, to handle different HTTP methods in an API route. Well-designed routes help us handle responses when a client makes requests to a specific endpoint or URL. Previously, we used the Fetch API on the front end to make GET requests to third-party APIs. During this module, we expand to using the Fetch API to make POST requests to an API that we create. We'll learn how client-side requests are related to server-side responses. Let's get started!
