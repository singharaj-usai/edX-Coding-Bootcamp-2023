# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Configure an Express.js app to handle GET and POST requests.

* Configure an Express.js app to serve static files.

* Identify how client-side requests relate to server-side responses.

* Parse optional and required parameters when creating server-side routes.

* Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server.

* Implement separation of concerns for routing.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

* [Custom middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html)

* [Heroku deployment](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs?singlepage=true)

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

For this module's Challenge, you'll create an application using Express.js and persistent storage that will allow users to take notes via a web interface. You'll create POST and GET routes to add and retrieve notes from persistent storage. The application will feature a sleek interface and demonstrate your knowledge of Express.js and routing. You'll also deploy the Note Taker application to Heroku using the Heroku CLI.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
