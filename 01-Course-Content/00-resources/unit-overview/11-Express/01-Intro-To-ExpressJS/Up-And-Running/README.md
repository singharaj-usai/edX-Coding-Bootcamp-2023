# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
For Insomnia and Heroku CLI, follow the installation instructions outlined here. For all other tools, check that you can access them.

In this module, you'll use the following tools:

* [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is considered the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) is a powerful REST API client that allows us to test APIs and make client-side server requests without having to use a browser.
  * Install Insomnia on your computer by visiting the [Insomnia download page](https://insomnia.rest/download) and following the instructions outlined there for your operating system.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a cloud application platform that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Unlike GitHub pages, which only allows you to deploy static sites with HTML pages, Heroku allows you to deploy a server.js file that will run the Node.js process. Youâ€™ll also use the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli), which will help you deploy apps easily without leaving the command line.
  * To install the Heroku CLI on your computer, refer to the [Heroku CLI installation guide on the Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/how-to-install-the-heroku-cli)
