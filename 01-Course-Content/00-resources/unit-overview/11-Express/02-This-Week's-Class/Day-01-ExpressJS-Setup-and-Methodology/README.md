# 11.1 Express.js Setup and Methodology
This week, you'll learn how to create server-side APIs using the Express.js back-end framework for Node.js. You'll also learn how to create an API, define routes, perform back-end logic, and save data using the built-in Node.js fs module.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Configure an Express.js app to handle GET and POST requests.

* Configure an Express.js app to serve static files.

* Identify how client-side requests relate to server-side responses.

* Parse optional and required parameters when creating server-side routes.

* Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server.

* Implement separation of concerns for routing.
