# 11.2 POST Requests and Persistent Data
In today's class, you'll learn how to test APIs using Insomnia. You'll also create POST routes on the back end and corresponding **fetch()** requests on the front end. You'll learn how to use middleware to parse JSON in your applications and how to implement persistent storage for the back end.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Perform HTTP requests using Insomnia.

* Configure an Express.js app to handle POST requests.

* Implement Express.js middleware to be able to read data from a POST request.

* Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server.

* Read and write to a JSON text file.
