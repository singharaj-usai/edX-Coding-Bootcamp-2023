# 11.3 Modular Routing, Custom Middleware, and Deployment
In today's class, you'll learn how to create modular routes for better organization. Additionally, you'll learn how to write custom middleware and use it for server-side applications. You'll deploy applications to Heroku using the Heroku CLI and also explore some lesser-known Git commands in this week's Git Guide on Git History.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Implement separation of concerns for routing.

* Write a custom middleware function for Express.js.

* Deploy a Node.js app to Heroku.

* Navigate Git History inside a large open source application.
