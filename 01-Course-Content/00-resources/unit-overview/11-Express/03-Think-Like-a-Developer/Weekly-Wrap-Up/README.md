### Express.js in the Workplace
Node.js has stirred up a lot of buzz in the development world, becoming one of the most popular server-side programming languages. And it is even more powerful when used with Express.js since it allows developers to quickly spin up servers by adding an npm package. For this reason, Node.js accompanied by Express.js is quickly being adopted for enterprise-level applications. What does that mean? Let’s discuss it.

### Enterprise applications assist companies in solving business problems. They differ from hobby or development applications in that they are held to a higher standard of quality control. In general, they have a high number of end users and high security needs.

Several years ago, languages like Node.js and Ruby were used primarily for hobby development. More established languages, like C# and Java, were reserved for enterprise applications due to their proven robustness. However, more and more companies are now rewriting the code for their enterprise applications in JavaScript using tools like Node.js and Express.js. Some of these companies are Walmart, NASA, Intel, and Twitter.

In summary, you are well equipped to enter the workforce with your attractive Node.js and Express.js skills.

Finding Your Career Fit: Creating an Competitive Resume

The career team collects a lot of data in order to provide you with the best career advice and assistance. Through discussions with tech employers, we have identified the essential components of an effective web development resume. Following our criteria for writing a competitive resume will help you secure interviews and job offers.

* To best serve your needs, we have differentiated the resume criteria according to three common student personas:

* Career starters: students with little to no prior career experience

* Career switchers: students who are pursuing a new industry or professional identity

* Career advancers: students who are pursuing growth in their current industry

Which persona best describes you? Once you have decided, you can click the corresponding link below and review the employer-backed resume criteria that best describes you:

* [Career-Starter Resume Criteria](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/employer-ready-criteria-for-web-development-career-starters/)

* [Career-Switcher Resume Criteria](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/employer-ready-criteria-for-web-development-career-switchers/)

* [Career-Advancer Resume Criteria](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/employer-ready-criteria-for-web-development-career-advancers/)

Now it's time to build a resume that meets these criteria! Once you’re done, you can **submit it for review via the Career Services tab in the course portal**. This will unlock access to job referrals and a Career Coach. Your Career Coach can help you job search, practice interviewing, network, negotiate salary, and more.

As always, we have lots of resources to help you implement these criteria and create the perfect resume, including the following templates and tools:

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 11 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/kR8SDXkDcTbPgJnQ8) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. Starting this week, we will provide weekly algorithm problems for you to work on.

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.
