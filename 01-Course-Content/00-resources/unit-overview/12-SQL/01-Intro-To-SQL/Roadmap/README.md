## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Use MySQL Shell to execute commands.

* Seed a database for use in application development.

* Perform CRUD functions using MySQL commands.

* Specify the relationship between tables using primary and foreign keys.

* Write a SQL query that joins two tables together.

* Implement **?** prepared statements in conjunction with **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**

* Perform a calculation on a set of values using aggregate functions.

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

You Challenge this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL2. Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
