# Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Use MySQL Shell to execute commands.

* Create a database schema.

* Seed a database for use in application development.

* Perform CRUD functions using MySQL commands.

* Specify the relationship between tables using primary and foreign keys.

* Write a SQL query that joins two tables together.

* Implement **?** prepared statements in conjunction with **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**

* Perform a calculation on a set of values using aggregate functions.

## Career Connection
Welcome to another Career Connection! This week, you learned Structured Query Language (SQL), which means that you can now work with databases. Data opens another door of possibility for our applications, and we are loving it.

### Today’s Career Connection Agenda
* SQL in the Workplace

* Finding Your Career Fit: Tailoring a Resume for a Particular Role

* Interview Prep

* Next Steps

### SQL in the Workplace
MySQL has been ranked the number one most-used database in the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-databases) for several years. This is why we teach it in this course. But what about the other databases? Let’s talk about two other relational databases that you may see on the job, and in job postings.

### PostgreSQL
Although not number one, PostgreSQL is incredibly popular. According to the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-databases), 40% of developers state that they have developed using PostgreSQL. Most would argue that PostgreSQL is a more advanced database than MySQL. Unlike MySQL, it supports advanced data types like arrays, hstore, and user-defined types. PostgreSQL also supports advanced security features.

### Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
MSSQL is owned by Microsoft, and must be purchased. Microsoft designed MSSQL for enterprise purposes, and thus it has several features that serve this audience. For example, MSSQL expects a large amount of storage space, has high security, and blocks the database while backing up data.

Guess what? Now that you know MySQL, you are well prepared to use these other relational databases. The syntax will be extremely similar.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Tailoring a Resume for a Particular Role

![](../../../images/coding-career-application-materials.png)

In a job description, an employer lets you know exactly what skills and experience they are looking for. Your task is to show the employer that you are a match. One way to do this is to tailor your resume to the job description.

Tailoring a resume ensures that recruiters see your alignment with the position, and shows your interest. It can also help you stand out to applicant tracking systems (ATS), which often look for keyword matches between job descriptions and resumes.

We suggest following these steps when tailoring a resume:

### Step 1: Review job description
Read through the entire job description, and highlight any skills or experiences that you have.

### Step 2: Align your brand statement
The brand statement (also known as a summary statement) is the first item that a recruiter reads on your resume. The skills, experiences, and interests that you describe should include the high-priority qualifications that you highlighted on the job description.

### Step 3: Move your most relevant qualifications to the top
Which section of your resume most clearly highlights your value to the company? Is it your technical skills, experience, or projects? Move the most relevant section to the top of your resume so that the recruiter sees it at the start.

### Step 4: Include keywords in descriptions
Review the descriptions of your projects and experiences. When possible, include keywords from the job description. You may also choose to reorder the information so that relevant points are near the top of a description.

**PRO TIP**
> We hope this goes without saying, but we want to remind you to never lie in your application materials in order to meet the qualifications of a job description. Being honest is the best way to ensure that you find a good career match.

That’s it!
[Ladders Inc.](https://www.theladders.com/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf) reports that recruiters only spend 7.4 seconds looking at your resume. By tailoring your resume, you ensure that the recruiter sees your very best qualifications in those 7.4 seconds.

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 12 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/iURNKwybewENCnS76) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. Starting this week, we will provide weekly algorithm problems for you to work on.

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [01: Multiply into 20](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/12-SQL/01-multiply-into-20.zip)

* [02: Zeroes and Ones](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/12-SQL/02-zeroes-and-ones.zip)

* [03: Merge Sorted](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/12-SQL/03-merge-sorted.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Multiply Into 20 problem:

Also, here is a problem for you to try on CodeSignal:

### Next Steps
* Consider adding SQL to the technical skills section of your application materials.
  
## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

In the next module, you will learn to use Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify your MySQL queries and easily handle data in a full-stack app.
