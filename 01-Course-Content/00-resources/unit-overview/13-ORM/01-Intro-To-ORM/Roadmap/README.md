# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Connect to a database using Sequelize and environment variables.

* Create and configure a Sequelize model.

* Perform CRUD operations with Sequelize methods.

* Write a script to seed a database with initial data.

* Convert asynchronous code to synchronous code using **async** and **await**.

* Catch errors using **try...catch**.

* Ensure that HTTP requests respond with the correct status code.

* Use validation tools on a Sequelize model.

* Encrypt a password using **bcrypt**.

* Automate functionality using Sequelize Hooks.

* Create and run a custom method on a Sequelize instance.

* Implement and know when to use different Sequelize associations for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

* Perform subqueries using a combination of Sequelize methods and plain SQL syntax.

* Enforce code styling for an application using ESLint.

* Deploy an application with a MySQL database to Heroku.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

* [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/)

    * [Models](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html)

    * [Data types](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#data-types)

    * [Associations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html)

    * [Model querying](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html)

    * [Validation and constraints](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/validations-and-constraints.html)

* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

* [async and await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)

* [try...catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)

* [RESTful routes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_web_services)

* [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

* [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

In this module's Challenge, you'll create an e-commerce back end. You will be given a working Express.js API that you'll have to configure using Sequelize. Once finished, you should be able to connect to the database, and you should have functioning CRUD commands.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
