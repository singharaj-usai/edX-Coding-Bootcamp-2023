# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
For the following tools, you don't need to install anythingâ€”just check that you can access them.

In this module, you'll use the following tools:

* [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) is a Promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, and read replication. Youâ€™ll use the [Sequelize package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) to add Sequelize to your Node.js applications.

* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a zero-dependency Node.js module that loads environment variables from a **.env** file into **process.env**, a Node.js property that returns an object containing the user environment. This allows developers to store user environment configurationâ€”or the things that are likely to vary between different deployments (passwords, secrets, keys, and so on)â€”separately from their code.

* [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) is a Node.js library that allows you to hash passwords. Hashing is the process of taking input and using a mathematical formula to chop and mix it up to produce an output of a specific length. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that it can easily convert input to a fixed-size output, but it is difficult to invert, or convert in the opposite direction. This attribute allows developers to secure passwords when authenticating users for their applications.

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code, covering both code quality and coding style, with the ability to configure and customize rules. For the purposes of this module, you'll use the [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) npm package.

* [JawsDB Add-On](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/jawsdb) is a Heroku add-on that provides a fully functional MySQL database server for use with your Heroku application. For our purposes, you'll use the free Kitefin Shared pricing plan.
