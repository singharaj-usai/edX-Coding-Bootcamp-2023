# 13.1 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
In today's class, you'll be introduced to the Sequelize ORM. Working with a Sequelize model, you'll use CRUD methods within Express.js routes. You'll also use **async** and **await** syntax to create a synchronous seed script.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Connect to a database using Sequelize and environment variables.

* Create and configure a Sequelize model.

* Perform CRUD operations with Sequelize methods.

* Write a script to seed a database with initial data.

* Convert asynchronous code to synchronous code using **async** and **await**.
