# 13.2 Authentication
As you continue to learn Sequelize in today's class, you'll also be formally introduced to RESTful API paradigms. Along with **async** and **await**, you'll use **try...catch** to properly catch errors and return them to the user. You'll incorporate validators and constraints to prevent bad data from being saved into the database. You'll also learn about password hashing with **bcrypt**, incorporating Hooks, and creating a secure login route for users.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Catch errors with **try...catch**.

* Ensure that HTTP requests respond with the correct status code.

* Perform checks on a Sequelize model with validation tools.

* Encrypt a password with **bcrypt**.

* Automate functionality using Sequelize Hooks.

* Create and run a custom method on a Sequelize instance.
