# 13.3 Relationships with Sequelize
Today's lesson focuses on how to relate data between SQL tables using Sequelize associations and how to model one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. You'll also learn how to write SQL subqueries with Sequelize literals, incorporate ESLint in a project, and deploy an application to Heroku with a MySQL database

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Implement various Sequelize associations to create one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many data relationships.

* Perform subqueries using a combination of Sequelize methods and plain SQL syntax.

* Enforce code styling for an application using ESLint.

* Deploy an application with a MySQL database to Heroku.
