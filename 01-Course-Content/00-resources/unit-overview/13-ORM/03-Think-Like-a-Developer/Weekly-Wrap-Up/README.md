# Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## Career Connection
Hello again! Time for another weekly dose of career content, helping you to understand how what you learned this week relates to your future development career.

### Today’s Career Connection Agenda

* Interview Prep

* Next Steps

### Web Security in the Workplace
In this module, we introduced the concept of building secure applications. Although some say "all publicity is good publicity," no company wants to be in the news for a data leak. Remember the Yahoo data breach in 2013 or Equifax data breach in 2017? Both of these instances cost the companies dollars and customers, but more importantly millions of individuals were negatively impacted. Equipping yourself with good ethics and skills is extremely important to your success as a developer.

If you work for a large or medium-sized corporation, you may be lucky enough to have an entire team that develops, manages, and/or tests the security of your web applications for you. If not, you may be responsible for the security of your own code. It can all sound a bit scary and overwhelming. Luckily, there are a lot of tools and resources available to help you, such as the bcrypt hash function that you used in this module. Another fun resource is the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/), which lists the most common web security vulnerabilities along with methods to protect against them.

Equally as important as building secure application technical skills is building your code of ethics. A good question to start asking yourself during development is "What security measures would I expect from this product if I were a user?"

Thanks in advance for the work that you will do to keep the web safe and secure!

### Finding Your Career Fit: Using the STAR Interview Strategy

![](../../../images/coding-career-application-interviews.png)

Within Career Services, we talk about the STAR interview strategy a lot! Our conversations with industry professionals, boot camp alumni, and hiring managers continue to confirm that STAR is the best way to structure interview responses for behavioral questions such as:

* Describe a time when you had to deal with a conflict in the workplace.

* Give me an example of a time that you showed leadership.

* What is one of your greatest professional accomplishments?

So what is STAR? It is a framework around which you can build responses to interview questions. It ensures that your responses are easy-to-follow, fully address the interviewer’s question, and highlight your valuable skills. Here’s the framework:

* Situation: Set the scene for the listener by sharing the context of the situation that you are about to discuss. This could include your role, key stakeholders, or work environment.

* Task: Describe the problem or challenge that you faced. For example, meeting a deadline, impressing a client, or a technical problem.

* Action: Explain how you solved the problem or overcame the challenge. This is your time to shine! Highlight the key skills that you utilized in the scenario. The interviewer will use your response to get an idea of how you would perform at their company.

* Results: End your story with success by describing what your actions achieved. If possible, use quantitative data to back up your results.

Now that you know the process, let’s look at an example. Here is a sample STAR response to the prompt "Tell me about a time when you made a mistake at work."

"Two years ago, I worked as a personal trainer at a local gym. The owners learned that I was good with technology so I started to also manage and edit their website. While doing edits, I mistakenly published the wrong address to the website. We had about five clients call in and miss their appointments before I realized where the problem was. Of course, I immediately corrected the mistake on the website. Before we realized what the problem was, we thought that clients were typing in the wrong address, so I also added a Google Maps plugin in order to hopefully bypass that problem. Additionally, I provided anyone impacted by the mistake with a one-month discount. Something that I learned from that experience is how important a quality assurance process is. After this situation, I started requesting reviews whenever I made serious changes to the site."

From this short response, we have learned a lot about the interviewee’s value. We know that they are recognized by their peers as being good at tech, they care about their clients, they learn from their mistakes, and they are creative problem-solvers. This is a much better response than a simple "Yes, one time I published the wrong address on a website."

Now, it is your turn. The best way to get good at STAR responses is to prepare and practice. Consider writing out a few STAR responses when you prepare for interviews.


# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 13 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/xH18Tn3PwctkCUBi9) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [01: Double Triple Map](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/13-ORM/01-double-triple-map.zip)

* [02: Array Intersection](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/13-ORM/02-array-intersection.zip)

* [03: Squares of a Sorted Array](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/13-ORM/03-squares-of-a-sorted-array.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Double Triple Map problem:

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

In the next module, we'll return to full-stack development and explore an architecture called Model-View-Controller (MVC). We'll also cover a templating engine called Handlebars.js. Finally, we'll learn a bit about front-end authentication.
