# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Render dynamic HTML using a template engine, like Handlebars.js.

* Explain and implement MVC modularization in a full-stack web application.

* Configure Heroku for deployment of an application using MySQL.

* Explain the interactions between the Model, View, and Controller.

* Explain separation of concerns and its benefits.

* Implement user authentication.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

* [Model-View-Controller](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC)

* [Sequelize model](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-basics/)

* [Handlebars.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
  * [Expressions](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html)
  * [Built-in helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html)
  * [Partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html#basic-partials)
  * [Custom helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars#helpers)

* Sessions and Cookies
  * [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)
  * [connect-session-store using Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize)
  * [Express.js session cookie](https://github.com/expressjs/session#cookie)

* [Express.js middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)

* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

For this module's Challenge, you'll be building a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the **express-session** npm package for authentication.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
