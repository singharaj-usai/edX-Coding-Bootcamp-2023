# 14.1 Model-View-Controller (MVC)
In today's class, you'll learn about the MVC framework and the separation of concerns. Starting with hardcoded data, you'll practice using template engines on the front end by implementing Handlebars.js expressions and built-in helpers. Then you'll use Sequelize and MySQL to handle data logic on the back end. In the process, you'll learn how the Controller mediates between the View and the Model by processing requests for data, using routes to manipulate the database, and passing serialized data to the View.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Implement MVC modularization in a full-stack web application.

* Render dynamic HTML using the Handlebars.js template engine.

* Dynamically pass data to other helpers or components using built-in helpers.

* Simplify objects by using data serialization, to work with necessary properties only.

* Explain the separation of concerns and its benefits.
