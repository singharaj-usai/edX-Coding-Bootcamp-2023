# Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Render dynamic HTML using a template engine, like Handlebars.js.

* Explain and implement MVC modularization in a full-stack web application.

* Configure Heroku for deployment of an application using MySQL.

* Explain the interactions between the Model, View, and Controller.

* Explain separation of concerns and its benefits.

* Implement user authentication.

## Career Connection
Previously, you focused on sending a JSON file back to the client that you could use to create webpages. This week, you learned a new way to do this, through templating and the MVC folder structure model. Your full-stack portfolio is looking better and better!

### Handlebars.js in the Workplace
With JavaScript being the most popular programming language, according to the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021), it is no surprise that Handlebars.js is one of most popular templating engines. But what if you plan to explore other languages? Most programming languages used for server-side web application development are compatible with a templating engine or use their own proprietary templating engine. Lucky for you, almost all work like Handlebars.js!

You may wish to start exploring these other tools. For each of the following programming languages, we’ve listed the name of its templating engine, so that you can click through them and poke around a little to see how they work.

* Java: [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)

* C#: [Razor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)

* Python: [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/)

* PHP: [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/blade)

You should note that each programming language can work with more than one templating language. The templating languages mentioned here are just some of the more popular ones you might encounter.

All of these templating languages are descendants of the great Mustache templating library, which is why we see the familiar **{{yourData}}** syntax throughout them.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Preparing for Technical Screenings

![](../../../images/coding-career-application-interviews.png)

Most tech employers ask their applicants to complete a technical screening. A technical screening is a step in which the employer assesses the technical abilities of a candidate.

If you are new to the tech world, the technical screening can be intimidating. This stage is likely different from other hiring processes that you have experienced. So today we want to demystify some aspects of the technical screening! Below is a list of the few types of technical screenings that you may encounter, along with some preparation resources.

## Technical Interview
This is similar to a typical behavioral interview, except the questions are designed to assess the applicant’s technical skills. For example, one might be asked, "How often do you test your code?" or "Tell me about a time when you worked with SQL."

Prep resources:

* [Coding Interview Prep Workshop](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/)
  
* Search "common technical interview questions" on your favorite search engine

* Schedule a mock interview with your Career Coach

### Online Technical Assessment
Usually a set of multiple choice and/or coding problems that the applicant completes virtually and on their own time. Most companies use platforms that enable applicants to write code directly into the interface.

Prep resources:

* [Breaking Down the Online Technical Assessment Workshop](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/)

(Highly recommended!)

* Practice on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)

* [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/developers/)

* or [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)

### Whiteboard Interview
An interview in which the interviewer asks the applicant to write code in real-time on a whiteboard (or virtual whiteboard equivalent).

Prep resources:

* 
[Hacking the Whiteboard Interview Workshop](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/)

* Schedule a mock interview with your Career Coach

### Take-home Task
A mini coding project that the applicant completes on their own time. Usually the task is similar to the work that the applicant would be expected to do if they were hired.

Prep resources:

* Research the job duties for the position. The task is likely to be similar to the actual on-the-job work.

The real key to mastering the technical screening is to practice coding. Practicing will increase your confidence, strengthen your problem-solving skills, and expose you to more solutions. If you have an online technical assessment or virtual whiteboard interview, we also recommend asking the employer which technology will be used so that you can practice with it before you enter the somewhat stressful situation of completing the assigned tasks.

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 14 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/ETRxZ6CtutAfpwpg6) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [01: Common Element](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/14-MVC/01-common-element.zip)

* [02: Permutation Substring](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/14-MVC/02-permutation-substring.zip)

* [03: Concert Flyer](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/14-MVC/03-Algorithms/03-concert-flyer.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Concert Flyer problem:

### Next Steps
Register for a workshop on the [Career Engagement Network Events page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/). We recommend "Breaking Down the Online Technical Assessment," "Coding Interview Prep," or "Hacking the Whiteboard Interview."

* Prepare for technical screenings by reviewing the problems in the Interview Prep pull-down of each Career Connection.

* Practice coding on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)

* , [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/developers/)

* , or [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

Next week, you'll start working on your second group project! In the next class, you'll be assigned to your project groups and receive the project requirements. Be sure to look over the project requirements carefully, and be ready to brainstorm project ideas with your group.
