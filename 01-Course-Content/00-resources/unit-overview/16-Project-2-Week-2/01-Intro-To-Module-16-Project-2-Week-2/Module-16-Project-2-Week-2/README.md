# Module 16: Project 2 Week 2
Welcome to the second week of Project 2! You'll continue to collaborate with your fellow developers to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

At the end of this week, you and your group will present your application to your fellow students in a group presentation. Use the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to prepare for the presentation. Because this is a full-stack web application, you and your fellow developers can concentrate on specific aspects of the project in your presentation, following the principle of the separation of concerns.

But while each individual should be able to speak about their contributions, this is still a group project. Be sure to emphasize how the different parts of your application came together and how you worked as a group!

You'll also update your professional materials, including your portfolio, GitHub profile, resume, and LinkedIn profile. Don't forget to add your new project to the portfolio once you've completed it!
