# Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project.

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project.

* Resolve merge conflicts.

* Explain agile software development.

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack web application to Heroku.

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project.

## Career Connection
Welcome back, everyone! We hope that you are enjoying the second week of your second project. This week, we will talk about how GitHub may show up in the workplace, and how to create a competitive GitHub profile.

### Today’s Career Connection Agenda
* GitHub in the Workplace

* Finding Your Career Fit: Creating a Competitive GitHub Profile

* Next Steps

### GitHub in the Workplace
In this course, we use Github to keep a record of our projects. You may wonder, is GitHub something that you will continue to use as a professional developer? Yes, it is! All developers use some kind of version control system. As you have seen, these systems enable developers to collaborate, track changes, and backup code.

GitHub is also useful for automating workflows. When coding in the workplace, it is likely that your team will have a standard practice for how they launch code to the master branch. For example, most individuals first commit their code to their own GitHub branch. Then the code goes through a quality assurance process before it is committed to the GitHub master branch and launched to the product.

Of course, GitHub isn’t the only version control system on the market. Other options include Bitbucket, GitLab, and AWS CodeCommit. Regardless of the product, the majority of companies invest in premium subscriptions of their version control system in order to ensure that their code is private and secure.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Creating a Competitive GitHub Profile

While we are on the topic of GitHub, let’s talk about your GitHub portfolio. Industry professionals tell us that they expect to see a GitHub portfolio linked in an applicant’s resume and application. They have also told us what they expect to see in a competitive GitHub portfolio.

Similar to the resume criteria that we reviewed in an earlier module, the GitHub criteria is differentiated by persona. Click on one of the following links to review the GitHub criteria that describes you best:

* [Career-Starter GitHub Criteria](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/employer-ready-criteria-for-web-development-career-starters/#:~:text=GitHub%20Profile%20Criteria)

* [Career-Switcher GitHub Criteria](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/employer-ready-criteria-for-web-development-career-switchers/#:~:text=GitHub%20Profile%20Criteria)

* [Career-Advancer GitHub Criteria](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/employer-ready-criteria-for-web-development-career-advancers/#:~:text=GitHub%20Profile%20Criteria)

We suggest setting aside some time this week to compare your GitHub profile with the criteria in this list. When you feel that your GitHub profile is in good shape, send it to a Career Material Advisor for review. You can do this via the Career Services tab in the course portal.

* [Building a Competitive GitHub & Online Technical Portfolio Workshop](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/)

### Next Steps
* Edit your GitHub profile so that it meets the employer-backed criteria.

* Submit your GitHub profile for review by a Career Material Advisor via the Career Services tab of the course portal.

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

In the next module, you'll get to delve further into JavaScript and learn how it relates to computer science. We are pulling back the curtains to examine some of the more challenging aspects of JavaScript. Get ready to learn all about data structures and closures!
