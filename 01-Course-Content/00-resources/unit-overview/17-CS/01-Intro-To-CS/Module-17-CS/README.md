# Module 17: Computer Science for JavaScript
In this module, we'll examine how computer science relates to JavaScript, to prepare you for the technical interview portion of the job interview—which every developer eventually faces. Some of these topics might seem abstract and confusing at times, but remember that you've been using JavaScript for several months. Now we're simply exploring more closely how JavaScript executes so that we can better understand how code interacts with its environment.

In the first two lessons, we'll dissect JavaScript to learn how code executes at a granular level. We'll also explore the fascinating behavior of closures and how we can leverage them in code. Finally, we'll compare inheritance and composition in application design.

In the final lesson, we'll review search algorithms and how recursion works in JavaScript. For the mini-project, you'll practice a mock interview with your peers. This will give you an opportunity to learn about the technical interview portion of the web developer job interview process. You'll address topics that are foundational to improving code performance and commonly found in technical interviews.
