# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Explain the differences between a global execution context and a function execution context.

* Identify when a function execution context is created and what is stored in it.

* Describe the functions of the call stack and the callback queue.

* Compare and contrast a stack vs. a queue in terms of LIFO and FIFO.

* Summarize asynchronous behavior and the role of the event loop.

* Construct a higher-order function.

* Explain the lexical environment.

* Identify encapsulated variables.

* Create a factory function.

* Distinguish between inheritance and composition design.

* Implement a linear search algorithm.

* Use recursion to solve a Fibonacci sequence algorithm.

* Implement a binary search algorithm and know when to use it over a linear search algorithm.

* Write shell scripts to be executed from the command line.

* Articulate and implement sorting algorithms in a technical interview setting.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

* [Global execution context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#global_context)

* [Functional execution context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#Function_context)

* [Data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

* [Event loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#Event_loop)

* [Higher-order functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

* [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

* [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)

* [Practical closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures/#Practical_closures)

* [Linear search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search)

* [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)

* [Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)

* [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)

* [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Merge_sort)

* [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Bubble_sort)

* [Quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Quicksort)

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

For this week's Challenge, you’ll create a technical tutorial that explains how a particular regular expression functions. A **regular expression**, or **regex**, is a search pattern used by developers. In the tutorial, you’ll break down each part of the expression and describe what it does.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
