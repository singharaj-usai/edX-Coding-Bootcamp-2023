# 17.1 How Does JavaScript Execute?
In this class, you'll be reintroduced to JavaScript within the context of some general computer science concepts. You'll learn about how JavaScript executes an application, including global and functional execution context, to understand how the various components work together to run a program. Along the way, you'll review various data structures, including stacks, queues, and callback queues. You'll also use the browser to understand the role of Web APIs and asynchronous behavior.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Explain the differences between a global execution context and a function execution context.

* Identify when a function execution context is created and what is stored in it.

* Describe the functions of the call stack and the callback queue.

* Compare and contrast a stack vs. a queue in terms of LIFO and FIFO.

* Summarize asynchronous behavior and the role of the event loop.

## 17.1 Activity Files
In class, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills with your instructional team and ask questions about the material for this week.

To prepare for full participation, be sure to download the following starter files and have them ready on your machine before class:
