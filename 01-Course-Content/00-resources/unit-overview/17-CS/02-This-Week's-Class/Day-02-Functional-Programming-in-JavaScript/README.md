# 17.2 Functional Programming in JavaScript
In today's class, you'll delve deep into how JavaScript executes. First you'll learn about higher-order functions and how to implement them. Then you'll explore closures, including how to leverage them using factory functions. You'll also learn about the difference between inheritance and a composition-based approach to designing an application. Finally, you'll be introduced to a new way to delegate events, by using closures.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Construct your own higher-order functions.

* Explain the lexical environment.

* Identify encapsulated variables.

* Create a factory function.

* Differentiate between inheritance and composition design.
