# 17.3 Algorithms, Recursion, and the Technical Interview
Today's lesson diverges from the JavaScript-specific topics of the previous lessons and introduces you to algorithms that you're likely to encounter during a technical interview. This class covers search algorithms, recursion, and a mock-interview practice with sorting algorithms.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Implement a linear search algorithm.

* Use recursion to solve a Fibonacci sequence algorithm.

* Implement a binary search algorithm and know when to use it over a linear search algorithm.

* Write shell scripts to be executed from the command line.

* Articulate and implement sorting algorithms in a technical interview setting.

## 17.3 Activity Files
In class, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills with your instructional team and ask questions about the material for this week.

To prepare for full participation, be sure to download the following starter files and have them ready on your machine before class:
