# Module 18: NoSQL
In this module, you'll learn about NoSQL databases and perform CRUD operations using MongoDB, a popular NoSQL document-based database. You'll also learn to use Mongoose, an object-document mapping (ODM) library, with your underlying MongoDB database to enforce a specific schema and handle data relationships. Deployment of an application using Mongo Atlas and Heroku is also covered.
