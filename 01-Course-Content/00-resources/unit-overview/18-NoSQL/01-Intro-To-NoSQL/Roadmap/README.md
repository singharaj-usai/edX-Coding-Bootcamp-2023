# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Create and manipulate data using MongoDB Compass.

* Insert, find, and return documents stored within a MongoDB database.

* Update and delete documents stored in a MongoDB database.

* Explain how embedded documents can be used to create one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.

* Limit, sort, and skip documents using MongoDB methods,

* Define the structure of the database with a Mongoose schema.

* Create a model to map to the MongoDB document and provide functionality.

* Execute CRUD queries using Mongoose.

* Explain the difference between an instance method and a static method.

* Create and manipulate a subdocument.

* Access MongoDB's aggregate framework through Mongoose's **aggegrate()** method.

* Implement a Mongoose virtual property to create computed properties.

* Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB Atlas.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

* [Visually exploring data with MongoDB Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/)

* [MongoDB databases and collections](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/)

* [MongoDB cursor methods](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/)

* [Mongoose models and schemas](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)

* [Mongoose CRUD operations](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html)

* [Mongoose instance methods](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods)

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

This week your Challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript **Date** object to format timestamps.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
