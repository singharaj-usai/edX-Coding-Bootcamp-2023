# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
For MongoDB, MongoDB Compass, and MongoDB Atlas, follow the installation and sign-up instructions outlined here. For all other tools, check that you can access them.

In this module, you'll use the following tools:

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a general purpose, document-based, distributed NoSQL database built for web application developers in the cloud era. Itâ€™s one of the most popular database choices for modern applications.
  * Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB and Compass on your computer.

* [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) is a MongoDB object-modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment, which supports both Promises and callbacks. Youâ€™ll use this package in conjunction with MongoDB to perform CRUD operations on data.

* [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) is an interactive tool for querying, optimizing, and analyzing MongoDB data. 
    * The [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) mentioned previously also covers installation of MongoDB Compass.

* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) is a cloud-based database service that is created and maintained by MongoDB. It works with hosting services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to help users provision, maintain, and secure new databases for their applications.
  * To sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account, refer to the [MongoDB Atlas setup guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-set-up-mongodb-atlas)
