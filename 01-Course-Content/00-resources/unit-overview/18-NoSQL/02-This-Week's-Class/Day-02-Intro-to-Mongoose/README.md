# 18.2 Introduction to Mongoose
In this class, you'll learn about Mongoose, a Node.js package that provides a schema-based solution that you can use to model Node.js application data. You'll also build on your knowledge of MongoDB and learn how Mongoose makes it easier to handle data from the database.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Define the structure of the database with schema, and use validators.

* Create a model to map to the MongoDB document.

* Execute CRUD queries using Mongoose.

* Explain how instance methods perform some action on a specific instance of a Model.

* Create and manipulate a document that is nested within another document.

* Access MongoDB's aggregate framework through Mongoose.
