# Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Create and manipulate data using MongoDB Compass.

* Insert, find, and return documents stored within a MongoDB database.

* Update and delete documents stored in a MongoDB database.

* Explain how embedded documents can be used to create one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.

* Limit, sort, and skip documents using MongoDB methods.

* Define the structure of the database with a Mongoose schema.

* Create a model to map to the MongoDB document and provide functionality.

* Execute CRUD queries using Mongoose.

* Explain the difference between an instance method and a static method.

* Create and manipulate a subdocument.

* Access MongoDB's aggregate framework through Mongoose's **aggegrate()** method.

* Implement a Mongoose virtual property to create computed properties.

* Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB Atlas.

## Career Connection
This week, we learned a cutting-edge technology that is rapidly being adopted by companies around the globe—NoSQL databases! Specifically, we learned MongoDB and an ODM called Mongoose, and there are others out there that you can explore on your own.

### NoSQL in the Workplace
"The right tool for the right job" is a useful philosophy in the world of web development. Instead of debating on the superiority of JavaScript vs. Python or React vs. Angular (this list goes on…), you need to learn how to choose the best tool for the project. You can put this into practice when choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases.

Although some may argue that one is better than the other, the fact is that SQL and NoSQL are both heavily used because they are both good at what they do well. SQL databases have great ease-of-use, security, predictability, and stability, but lack some ability to scale. NoSQL databases are easy to scale and more flexible, but lack the standardization and maturity that SQL has.

In this course, you have learned to use both SQL and NoSQL databases. Moving forward in your career, you should feel equipped to choose the best database for the project at hand.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Designing a Standout Online Portfolio

![](../../../unit-overview/images/coding-career-application-materials.png)

Some companies may request an online portfolio as part of their application process. We celebrate this as an opportunity for you to stand out from the crowd and show off your skills.

You likely already understand that your portfolio should be organized, well-designed, and showcase your strengths. We’ve laid out these basic requirements in this [Portfolio Guide](https://careernetwork.2u.com/articles/portfolio-and-github-web-development/#:~:text=Building%20a%20Competitive%20Portfolio). Today we want to discuss an element that will make your portfolio stand out.

Disclaimer: Today’s advice is targeted at students starting their career and students switching industries. If this doesn’t apply to you, then you may already be implementing the following advice.

The #1 portfolio tip that hiring managers tell us is for new developers is to add both personal and enterprise projects. While your course projects are valuable learning opportunities and certainly demonstrate your advanced skills, employers also need to see what differentiates you from a pool of applicants. We suggest including your course projects in your portfolio, and adding 1-2 non-course projects.

These 1-2 projects should highlight your interests and skills. They should also be relevant to the types of jobs that you are applying to. Use the technology that you want to use on the job, show off your transferable skills, and solve problems that you find interesting.

Here are a few ideas to help you get started:

* Help out a friend’s small business.

* Build something related to one of your hobbies.

* Build something for your current employer.

* Create a project related to a specific job description. (For example, if you want to work on robo advisors, build a unique robo advisor.)

* Expand upon one of your course projects.

We hope that this tip helps you take your portfolio from great to exceptional.

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 18 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/q1Up3Ea79a75wUUDA) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [01: Valid Brackets](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/18-NoSQL/01-valid-brackets.zip)

* [02: Min Increment for Unique](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/18-NoSQL/02-min-increment-for-unique.zip)

* [03: Peak Finder](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/18-NoSQL/03-peak-finder.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Valid Brackets problem:

Also, here is a problem for you to try on CodeSignal:

### Next Steps
* Consider adding NoSQL to the technical skills section of your application materials.

* Ideate on personal projects that you could add to your GitHub profile or online portfolio in order to stand out from other applicants.

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

Next week, you'll learn about **progressive web applications (PWAs)** and explore tools to improve both performance and offline capability. To learn more, refer to the [MDN Web Docs on progressive web apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)
