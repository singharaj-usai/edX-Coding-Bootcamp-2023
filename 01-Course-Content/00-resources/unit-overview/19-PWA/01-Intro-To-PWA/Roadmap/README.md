# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Recognize which metrics in a Lighthouse audit affect page-load times.

* Identify the main purpose of a module bundler like webpack.

* Set up webpack dependencies in an application using npm scripts.

* Create a bundle and use it to provide interaction for a webpage.

* Compare webpack in development with production mode.

* Extend webpack’s functionality for non-JavaScript files, transpile modern JavaScript for older browsers, and automate bundle output file names.

* Create an index.html file using a template with a webpack plugin to automate bundle insertion.

* Implement service workers to a web application.

* Leverage caching strategies to optimize performance.

* Execute a full-stack application with a server and client-side development server.

* Implement IndexedDB inside of a JavaScript application.

* Implement create, read, update, and delete commands for an IndexedDB instance.

* Convert an existing application into a progressive web application (PWA).

* Deploy a PWA to Heroku.

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

For this week's Challenge, you'll build a simple text editor with JavaScript syntax highlighting. The text editor will be a progressive web application, which will enable users to install and use it offline. The application will be bundled with webpack and will take advantage of Babel to use modern JavaScript in the browser.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
