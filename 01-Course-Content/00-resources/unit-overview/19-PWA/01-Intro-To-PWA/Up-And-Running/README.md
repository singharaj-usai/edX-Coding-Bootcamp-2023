# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
For the following tools, you don't need to install anything—just check that you can access them.

In this module, you'll use the following tools:

* Google Lighthouse helps improve the performance of web applications by providing audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more. It's included in Chrome DevTools.

* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a module bundler for JavaScript that simplifies front-end web development by generating static assets from modules with dependencies and using plugins and loaders to help automate certain optimization strategies. You'll use the [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) and [webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli) packages, as well as the [webpack-pwa-manifest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-pwa-manifest), [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server), [workbox-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-webpack-plugin), and [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) packages. You'll also use the following loader modules with webpack: css-loader, [babel-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader), and [style-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/style-loader).

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is an open source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines. You'll use the [@babel/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/core), [@babel/plugin-transform-runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/plugin-transform-runtime), [@babel/preset-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/preset-env), and [@babel/runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/runtime) packages.

* [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) is a set of libraries that allows you to easily power a production-ready service worker for a progressive web application. You'll use the following packages to access Workbox in your applications: [workbox-cacheable-response](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-cacheable-response), [workbox-precaching](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-precaching), [workbox-routing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-routing), [workbox-strategies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-strategies), [workbox-window](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-window), [workbox-expiration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-expiration), and [workbox-recipes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-recipes).

* [idb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb) is a small wrapper library that mirrors the IndexedDB API—a NoSQL web storage API in the browser—but it adds small improvements that make the API easier to use.

* [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is a simple, zero-configuration command-line static HTTP server that you'll use when testing your applications locally.

* The [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) npm package allows you to run multiple processes, or servers, from a single command-line interface. Rather than opening multiple terminals to start the multiple servers, you can run them both at the same time. It also allows you to keep track of different outputs in one place, and will stop all of your processes even if one of them fails.

## How to Use Your Tools
Learning how to use your web development tools effectively can take time. Try to be patient with yourself, and refer to the following useful resources for extra guidance.
