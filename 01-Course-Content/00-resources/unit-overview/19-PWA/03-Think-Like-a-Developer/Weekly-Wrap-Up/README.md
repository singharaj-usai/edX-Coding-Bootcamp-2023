Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Recognize which metrics in a Lighthouse audit affect page-load times.

* Identify the main purpose of a module bundler like webpack.

* Set up webpack dependencies in an application using npm scripts.

* Create a bundle and use it to provide interaction for a webpage.

* Compare webpack in development with production mode.

* Extend webpack’s functionality for non-JavaScript files, transpile modern JavaScript for older browsers, and automate bundle output file names.

* Create an **index.html** file using a template with a webpack plugin to automate bundle insertion.

* Implement service workers to a web application.

* Leverage caching strategies to optimize performance.

* Execute a full-stack application with a server and client-side development server.

* Implement create, read, update, and delete commands for an IndexedDB instance.

* Convert an existing application into a progressive web application (PWA).

* Deploy a PWA to Heroku.

## Career Connection
Congratulations on completing another week of boot camp! This week, we will discuss PWAs in the workplace and salary negotiation.

* Progressive Web Applications in the Workplace

* Finding Your Career Fit: Negotiating Salary

* Interview Prep

* Next Steps

### Progressive Web Applications in the Workplace
Google was the first to coin the term PWA in 2015 to describe its web application that runs on modern web browsers. Since then, PWAs have become one of the most popular buzzwords in web development.

Honestly, PWAs deserve the hype. They immensely improve the user experience, and companies are seeing major returns. Starbucks’ PWA is 99.84% smaller than Starbucks’ iOS app, and its launch resulted in the doubling of web orders, according to this [article from Formidable on Starbucks PWA](https://formidable.com/work/starbucks-progressive-web-app/). Large companies like Pinterest, Yummly, Spotify, and Uber have seen similarly striking returns.

What this means is that you can expect to hear about PWAs in interviews and on the job. They will surely remain a hot topic for years to come.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Negotiating Salary

[](../../../images/coding-career-job-offers.png)

Eek! Salary negotiation is a scary step in the hiring process for many of us. Today, we will talk about how to prepare for the conversation, and discuss tips that you can use if you decide to negotiate.

First up is preparation! The steps below will help you decide on your worth.

### Step 1: Research
Research the range, median, and average salary for the roles that you are interested in. Try to factor in years of experience and education level into your research. Here are some helpful websites to help you get started:

* [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/)

* [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/)

* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm)

### Step 2: Determine your ideal salary
Consider your personal finances and the research from step 1. Decide on a salary that you would accept from an offer. You may also want to decide on a "walk-away number," a salary amount that you are unwilling to consider.

Now that you have determined your ideal salary, let’s discuss some tips for negotiating salary. Here are some of our recommendations:

* Express your interest in the role: Negotiating salary doesn’t have to be a negative experience. Convey that you are excited about the role, and interested in agreeing upon an offer that you can accept.

* Let the company go first: Do your best to get the company to pick a number first. You do not want to risk limiting yourself by being the first to pick a number.

* Ask questions: Questions can help you get a better understanding of the company’s flexibility. Consider asking "How did your team settle on this number?" or "How do raises or promotions occur at the company?".

Also, remember you can negotiate terms other than salary. Signing bonuses, PTO, health benefits, cultural perks, professional development, retirement funds, stock options, and equity are other negotiable terms.

As always, we have lots of resources for you! Click the following links to learn more about salary negotiation:

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 19 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/FAgrQSCzrJxN6sj89) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [02: Max Profit](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/19-PWA/02-max-profit.zip)

* [03: Smallest Difference](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/19-PWA/03-smallest-difference.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Is Armstrong problem:

### Next Steps
* Consider adding PWAs to your application materials.

* Prepare for salary negotiations by researching the average salary for your dream role.

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

In the next module, you'll get your first introduction to React, a front-end library created by Facebook. React will take your front-end web development skills to the next level. You'll get to learn all about components, state, Hooks, and much more. React is a hot commodity in the software engineering field!
