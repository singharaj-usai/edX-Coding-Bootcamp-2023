# Module 20: React
In this module, you'll learn how to create a **single-page application (SPA)** using React. React is a powerful and elegant technology, as well as a very in-demand skill to have as a web developer. As you create your SPA, you'll learn how to use React components, manage application state, and pass data throughout your app. You'll get a sense for how React works under the hood and the problems it solves in modern web development. By the end of this module, you'll be one step closer to being employer-ready.
