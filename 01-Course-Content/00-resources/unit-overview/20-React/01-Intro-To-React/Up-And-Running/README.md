# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
For **npx**, follow the instructions outlined here. For all other tools, check that you can access them.

In this module, you'll use the following tools:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) is an open source, declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Itâ€™s maintained by Facebook, and it can be used to develop single-page applications (SPA). Youâ€™ll use the [create-react-app package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) to build your first React application.

* [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx), or **node package execute**, is a Node.js utility that allows developers to execute any package in the npm registry without having to actually install the package. You'll use **npx** to ensure that you're using the latest version of **create-react-app** available. **npx** automatically finds the correct package without it needing to be installed globally.

  * The **npx** tool has been bundled with **npm** since version 5.2, so it should be installed already, but just to be sure, you can run the following command to ensure you have it installed:

> npx --version

A release number should print to your terminal.
