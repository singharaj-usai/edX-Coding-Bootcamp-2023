# 20 Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Identify the differences between a class-based and functional-based component.

* Identify the pros and cons of using React single-page applications (SPAs).

* Use React props.

* Manage state using React.

* Use React Hooks.

* Use Jest to test React components.

## Career Connection
You finally made it to React! Is it everything you dreamed it would be? The world of React is a lot of fun, and we are happy to welcome you to it.

### Today’s Career Connection Agenda
* React in the Workplace

* Finding Your Career Fit: Starting a New Job

* Interview Prep

* Next Steps

### React in the Workplace
In the [2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks), React was voted the most popular option for web frameworks, and used by 40.14% of respondents. It finally surpassed jQuery, which sits at 34.42% usage, but this is no surprise because as we discussed in earlier modules, jQuery is largely used in legacy applications.

Knowing the most popular technology in a space has advantages, which is why we teach React in this course. You now have access to a large community of resources, and a wide range of job postings. Additionally, if you find yourself hiring developers, you will have a large pool of talent to hire from.

Still, you may be interested in learning other JavaScript front-end frameworks. The two most popular alternatives to React are Angular and Vue.js. Angular is a framework originally developed by Google in 2010, and Vue.js is an open source project founded in 2014. The concepts and skills you’re learning for React transfer directly to Angular and Vue.js. So if you see job openings that call for Angular or Vue.js experience, apply!

### Finding Your Career Fit: Starting a New Job

Once you lock in that new job, you will want to make a good first impression with your team. Here are our top five tips for a successful first day:

### 1. Reach out one week before your start date
Set yourself up for success by sending an email to your manager before your start date. In the email, confirm the day, start time, and location; ask any remaining questions; and convey your excitement.

### 2. Do a test run
If you are working in person, consider doing a test drive of your commute. If you are working remotely, test your technology and ensure that your internet connection is strong.

### 3. Introduce yourself
Your first week is the perfect time to introduce yourself to as many people as possible. Consider preparing a two-minute introduction that you can share at meetings throughout the week. Your intro should include your role, your past experiences, your skills, and fun facts about you.

### 4. Schedule 1:1 chats
Schedule 15-minute chats with everyone on your immediate team, and people that you want to get to know in the company. This will ensure that you have unobstructed time to get to know your peers and ask questions.

### 5. Put your phone away
Even if you see other co-workers using their personal phone, it is off-limits for your first day at work. If you want to make a good impression, you need to be professional. Turn your phone on silent and keep it out of sight.

Remember that they already like you! You got the job! Let yourself relax a bit, and enjoy your first day in your new role.

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 20 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/jV3WDxHsEEusHjNr9) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [02: Merge Meeting Times](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/20-React/02-merge-meeting-times.zip)

* [03: Int to Roman](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/20-React/03-int-to-roman.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Merge Meeting Times problem:

### Next Steps
* Consider adding React to the technical skills section of your application materials.

* Register for a workshop at the [Career Engagement Network events page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/). We have more than 50 workshops designed to meet you where you’re at in achieving your career goals.

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

In the next module, you'll add React to some of the other technologies you've learned, including MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js, to create full-stack MERN applications.
