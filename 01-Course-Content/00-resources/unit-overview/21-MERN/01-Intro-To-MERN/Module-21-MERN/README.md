# Module 21: MERN
In this module, you'll use your skills in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to build a full-stack MERN app.

You’ll use React Router to make the application behave more like a multi-page application, allowing users to bookmark URLs and use the browser’s forward and back buttons. You’ll also add GraphQL, an open source data query and manipulation language for APIs that lets you fetch only the data you want from the database when you need it. Finally, you’ll learn how to use a JSON Web Token, or JWT, to add authentication to your site.
