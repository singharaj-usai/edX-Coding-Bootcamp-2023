# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Define a GraphQL schema and implement resolvers to handle data population.

* Write a GraphQL query to read data with and without parameters.

* Use a GraphQL mutation to create and update data.

* Execute queries and mutations using **useQuery()** and **useMutation()** Hooks.

* Update GraphQL's in-memory cache.

* Implement client-side routing by using React Router.

* Securely transmit data as a JSON object using JWT.

* Implement server-side authentication in GraphQL API.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

* [Apollo Sandbox](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/sandbox/#publishing-schemas-from-sandbox)

* [GraphQL Query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)

* [Resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/resolvers/)

* [Query parameters](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/)

* [Mutations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/)

* [useMutation Hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/mutations/)

* [useQuery Hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/queries/)

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

* [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction)

* [Authentication in GraphQL API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/security/authentication/)

* [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

As a developer, you'll often be tasked with working with an existing codebase and updating the app to use a new technology. For this module's Challenge, you'll take an existing book search engine that was built using a RESTful API and refactor it to use a GraphQL API.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
