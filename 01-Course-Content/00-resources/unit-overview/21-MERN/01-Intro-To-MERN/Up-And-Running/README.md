# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
For the following tools, you don't need to install anythingâ€”just check that you can access them.

In this module, you'll use the following tools:

* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with your existing data, giving clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. For this moduleâ€™s application, youâ€™ll use the [graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql) package to parse GraphQL syntax in both your front-end and back-end codebase.

* [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) is an open source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), the client youâ€™ll use in your **MERN** application. Youâ€™ll use the [apollo-server-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-express) package to integrate GraphQL into your Express.js server, and the [@apollo/client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) package to make requests from your React front end to the GraphQL API.

* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application, allowing you to make your single-page React applications behave more like multi-page applications. You'll use the [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) npm package to work with React Router in your applications.

* JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs, are an alternative to using session cookies for authentication. Youâ€™ll use the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) package in your MERN applications.

* [jwt-decode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode) is an npm package that helps decode JWTs from their Base64Url encoding. Youâ€™ll use it to extract non-sensitive data such as the tokenâ€™s expiration date to see if itâ€™s expired before making a request to the server.

## How to Use Your Tools
Learning how to use your web development tools effectively can take time. Try to be patient with yourself, and refer to the following useful resources for extra guidance.
