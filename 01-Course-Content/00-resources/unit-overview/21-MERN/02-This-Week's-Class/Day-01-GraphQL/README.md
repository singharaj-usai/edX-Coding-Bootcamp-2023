# 21.1 GraphQL
This class covers GraphQL, including using the Apollo Server to set up **typeDefs** and **resolvers**, making queries and using mutations, and using the Apollo Sandbox. You'll also learn about the three-layer MERN architecture.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Explain how the client, server, and database layers work together to build a full-stack MERN app.

* Integrate an Apollo Server with Express.js to create GraphQL server.

* Write queries using the GraphQL query language.

* Design a schema using **typedefs** and **resolvers**.

* Use mutations to modify server-side data.
