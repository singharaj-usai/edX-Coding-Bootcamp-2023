# 21.2 Integrating the Front-End

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Explain what an API is and identify an API's role in a MERN app.

* Create a full-stack MERN app for use in both development and production environments.

* Use **useQuery** and **useMutation** Apollo Hooks to fetch and update data.

* Explain what the Apollo Cache is and identify when it needs updating.

* Use React Router to tie a component to a URL route.
