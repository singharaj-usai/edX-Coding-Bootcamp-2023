# 21.3 JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
This class focuses on using JSON Web Tokens to add authentication to a MERN-stack application. You'll also work in groups to refactor a fully functioning MERN-stack app to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server and Apollo Client.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Create and verify a JSON Web Token to log in the user.

* Store, check expiration of, and pass JSON Web Tokens to an Apollo Client.

* Implement server-side authentication in GraphQL API.

* Explain a practical use case for implementing GitHub Actions.
