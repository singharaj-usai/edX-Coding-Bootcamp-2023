# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Pass and store data down a React component tree using the Context API **Provider**.

* Consume data passed between components using the Context API **Consumer**.

* Implement Redux to manage state in a React application.

* Implement local and global state using the **useReducer** Hook.

* Describe the functionality of the **StoreProvider** component.

* Identify use cases for complex state management tools including the Context API and Redux.

* Implement the Stripe payment platform in a MERN application.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

* [Context.Provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider)

* [Context.Consumer](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextconsumer)

* [Redux reducers](https://redux.js.org/faq/reducers/)

* [Redux actions](https://redux.js.org/faq/actions/)

* [useReducer React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

* [useState React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

* [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

* [JWT authentication](https://jwt.io/introductionr)

* [GraphQL type definitions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/schema/#object-types)

* [Stripe payment platform](https://stripe.com/docs)

## Challenge
In addition to the live class sessions and other coursework, you'll complete a weekly Challenge assignment that provides you with crucial real-world practice and helps you prepare for a career in web development.

**IMPORTANT**

> This week's Challenge is extra credit. It is not required for submission, nor will it count towards one of the two assignments that you can skip. If you choose to submit this Challenge, you will receive extra credit points on your final grade. However, if you choose not to submit it, your final grade will not be affected in any way. This Challenge is an opportunity for you to further practice your skills and get feedback on it, with the added incentive of receiving extra credit for the work.

Your Challenge for this module is to refactor an e-commerce platform from your in-class activities so that it uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to an external site.. You won’t need to make sweeping changes to the code, but you will need to read through the Redux documentation on your own to find the information you need. You'll have the opportunity to download this code on the Challenge page of this module.

## Get Started
Now that you've had a brief overview of the material for this coming week, you can move on to Up and Running to ensure that you have all the tools you'll need.

Let's go!
