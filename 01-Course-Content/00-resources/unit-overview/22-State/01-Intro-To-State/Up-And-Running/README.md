# Up and Running
A web developer relies on numerous tools to perform everyday tasks. Let's review the tools that you'll use this week, as well as some useful resources for extra help as you learn and practice.

## Tools for This Week
For the following tools, you don't need to install anythingâ€”just check that you can access them.

In this module, you'll use the following tools:

* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a suite of online payment processing APIs that powers commerce for online businesses of all sizes, allowing them to accept and process payments online. Some of this module's applications will use the [stripe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stripe) to an external site. npm package.

* [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js) is Stripeâ€™s JavaScript library for building payment flows. It uses Stripe Elements, a set of prebuilt, customizable UI components to allow platforms to collect sensitive payment information. Stripe.js also provides a single interface for Apple Pay, Google Pay, and the Payment Request API. Some of this module's applications will use the [@stripe/stripe-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/stripe-js) npm package.

* The [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) is a native React utility that allows developers to manage and centralize an application's state, sharing data to multiple components by storing it in a central place and allowing access to any component that requests it.

* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is an open source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing an application's state, and it's frequently used alongside React. For this module's mini-project and Challenge, you'll use the [redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) and [react-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux) packages.
