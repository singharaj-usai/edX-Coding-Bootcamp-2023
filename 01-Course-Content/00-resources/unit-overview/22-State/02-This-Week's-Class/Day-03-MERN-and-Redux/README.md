# 22.3 MERN and Redux
Today's lesson will further explore complex state management in MERN-stack applications. You'll review using type definitions with Apollo Server, creating a global store, and refactoring an app to use Redux instead of the React Context API.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of class, you'll be able to do the following:

* Create type definitions for Apollo Server applications.

* Implement a store provider in a React App using the Context API.

* Explain how the reducer function helps manage complex state with libraries like Redux.
