# Weekly Wrap-Up
Congratulations on your progress so far! By completing another week of the boot camp, you've taken more crucial steps in your journey to become a web developer.

Now is a great time to reflect on what you learned, connect that knowledge to your future job search and career, and practice using your skills in real-world applications.

Here we've provided extra resources, assessments, and technical interview prep to help you do that.

## What You Learned
You're making fantastic progress! This week in particular, you learned how to do the following:

* Pass and store data down a React component tree using the Context API **Provider**.

* Consume data passed between components using the Context API **Consumer**.

* Implement Redux to manage state in a React application.

* Implement local and global state using the **useReducer** Hook.

* Describe the functionality of the **StoreProvider** component.

* Identify use cases for complex state management tools including the Context API and Redux.

* Implement the Stripe payment platform in a MERN application.

## Career Connection
This week, you really brought everything together—the entire MERN stack. Congratulations!

### Clean Code in the Workplace
This week, you used refactoring to make your code “cleaner.” Writing and maintaining clean code is an important skill because it makes it easy for you or someone else to modify in the future, and can even cut down runtime. Companies are so obsessed with clean code that many have programming style guides for their employees to follow.

A programming style guide usually includes programming conventions, styles, and best practices for a team or project. Examples include how to use indentations and how to name variables. Additionally, style guides may include folder naming conventions and hierarchy structure.

Here are two style guides that you can explore today:

* [Google Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)

* [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

If you plan to work as an entrepreneur or contractor, it is a good idea to develop your own style guide. Though developing a style guide and writing clean code can seem time consuming at first, it definitely pays off in the long run.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Asking for a Raise or Promotion

![](../../../images/coding-career-on-the-job.png)

Soon, many of you will be launching into a new career! You have worked hard to complete this rigorous boot camp, to stand out in interviews, and to make a good first impression with your new team. As the dust settles and you relax into your new role, you may find that you need to check your work-life balance.

It is healthy to think of work-life balance as a continuous and dynamic process, rather than something to be achieved. As life circumstances change, our priorities should change accordingly. In general, a healthy work-life balance results in deadlines being met, time with friends, proper sleep, healthy eating, and work-free thoughts after work hours.

If you find yourself feeling off-balance, we recommend taking a step back to reprioritize. Work-life balance looks different for everyone, but we do have few tips that you can try out:

* Reflect on how you spend your work hours, and brainstorm how you can “work smarter, not longer.”

* Make a list of priorities, and ensure that they are reflected in your schedule.

* Work in short-focused bursts using productivity apps like PomofocusLinks to an external site..

* Schedule time away from technology.

* Use your PTO.

* Build healthy habits so that your health becomes a regular part of your routine.

We hope that you find these tips useful. You have worked hard to get to the end of this boot camp and into your dream career. You deserve to enjoy all that you have achieved!

# INTERVIEW PREP
#### Let’s do some interview prep!

**Practice Interview Questions**

Sometimes employers will ask you to complete an online assessment. Try out the multiple-choice [Module 22 Technical Interview Assessment](https://forms.gle/o4dUzpW3AS8xVi868) for practice.

**Algorithm-based Interview Questions**

Each algorithm has instructions, an **Unsolved** folder, and a **Solved** folder. Try to solve each problem first, then study the solution.

* [02: Rotation Point](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/22-State/02-rotation-point.zip)

* [03: Simplify Path](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/algorithms/22-State/03-simplify-path.zip)

The following video will help you work out the solution to the Caesar Cipher problem:

### Next Steps
* In the spirit of work-life balance, do something enjoyable for yourself today!

## Prepare for Next Week
If you haven't yet, be sure to complete and turn in all Challenge assignments for this week. Once you've done that, you can turn your attention to the upcoming module.

During the next module, you'll build on your full-stack app development skills as you learn about state management and the Context API. You'll also review the key concepts covered in this module to help you prepare for your final project.
