# Roadmap
Let's explore what you'll learn and accomplish in the upcoming module, and review some resources that will help you along the way.

## What You Will Learn
This week, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project.

* Explain and execute Git branching workflow in a collaborative project.

* Resolve merge conflicts.

* Explain agile software development.

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack MERN application to Heroku.

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project.

## Key Topics
You'll learn about the following key topics during your live class sessions—follow the links for extra support during independent practice:

* Full-stack MERN applications

* [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

* [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

* Collaborative development

## Project 3: Interactive MERN SPA Project
You'll finish your project and give a presentation on it in class. Then you'll update your portfolio page and other professional materials to build towards being employer-competitive.

## Finishing the Boot Camp
You started this course with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer. You’ve now gone well beyond that goal, picking up critical soft skills and adding cutting-edge technologies that will help you stand apart from the field of junior developers. You’ll finish this class with a certification in web development, but that’s not what really makes you a developer.

As we’ve mentioned again and again, developers have a ceaseless desire to learn, and you’ve proven that you possess this trait. You’ve learned a lot in six months! This course allowed you to develop the skills and habits you need to get started coding, but your dedication to learning and to solving real-world problems will ensure that you always think like a developer.

Take a moment to marvel at everything you’ve learned how to do, and how this relates to real-world scenarios you encounter every day. Think of how many times you’ve pulled up a site on your phone and had to deal with a poor internet connection. Think of how you’ve still been able to interact with this site in spite of this. Now remind yourself that you’ve created applications with that exact functionality!

Think about all the social networks you use on a daily basis. Imagine how many users across the world use these same sites and how these user demands create the need for performant and efficient technologies—the same technologies that you’re using to create lightning-fast applications that do all the same things your favorite social networks can do.

Review the events of your day and try to think of how many times you used a payment platform on a website. Many of those sites likely use the same payment platform you learned to work with in this course, and you now have the skills to add that to your apps!

Finally, think of where you were six months ago and where you are today. You ARE a developer. And you always will be.
