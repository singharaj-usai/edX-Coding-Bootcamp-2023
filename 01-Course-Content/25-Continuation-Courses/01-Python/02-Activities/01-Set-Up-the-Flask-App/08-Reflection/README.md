# Reflection

You've done a fantastic job exploring a new programming language! The syntax of Python greatly differs from that of JavaScript, but as you've learned so far, the concepts of routing and modularity remain the same.

In this lesson, you accomplished the following:

* Set up a virtual environment using the `venv` module.

* Defined functions using the `def` keyword.

* Created packages and modules and imported them into other modules.

* Used the Flask library to render Jinja templates.

You now have the basis for a Flask app, but it isn't useful without data. Next, you'll build the database models and start populating the MySQL tables through Python scripts.
