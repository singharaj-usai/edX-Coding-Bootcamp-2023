# Reflection

You've learned another useful Python library, in the form of SQLAlchemy. Because the concept of ORMs is universal, SQLAlchemy solves the same problem that Sequelize solves in a Node.js project. Even though the functions work a bit differently, they share the same principles regarding column types, relationships, and validation.

* In this lesson, you accomplished the following:

* Defined models by using Python classes.

* Created MySQL tables using SQLAlchemy column options.

* Handled errors using the `assert` keyword.

You also seeded your database with test data, so you can now focus on pulling that data into the templated routes that you set up earlier. Next, you'll finish the homepage templates!
