# Reflection

In this lesson, you built on the Flask app you created earlier, and you introduced your SQLAlchemy models into the routes and templates. Some things required a bit more manual setup and teardown than what you're used to in JavaScript, but the data ended up being used the same way.

In this lesson, you accomplished the following:

* Queried a database using SQLAlchemy methods.

* Managed database connections using the Flask app context.

* Imported custom filters into a Jinja template.

Okay, so we've taken care of the homepage and the single-post page. We still need to finalize the dashboard side of the app, but that will require users to be able to log in. Next, we'll explore how to implement logins and sessions when using Flask!
