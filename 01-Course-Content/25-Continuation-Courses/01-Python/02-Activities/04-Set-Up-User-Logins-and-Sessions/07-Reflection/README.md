# Reflection

Fantastic! You've completed a challenging aspect of any web application: user authentication. Users can now create accounts, log in, and log out.

Implementing these features allowed you to further expand your knowledge of Python and Flask as you accomplished the following tasks:

* Captured data in a Flask POST route by using the `request` object.

* Persisted data across routes by using the `session` object.

* Handled database errors by using `try...except` statements.

The Just Tech News app is now almost fully usable. It's just missing a few more API routes to allow the creation of posts and comments. We'll finish building those routes next!
