# Reflection

At this point, you've taken care of the remaining features. Users can now create posts, comments, and upvotes. This was a great way to practice using Flask routes and SQLAlchemy models. You also learned some more advanced Python features to make the app more secure.

Specifically, you accomplished the following:

* Updated and deleted data by using SQLAlchemy methods.

* Created a custom decorator function to act as route middleware.

You have a finished Just Tech News app, but it runs only locally. You should publish it somewhere for the world to use!

In the next lesson, we'll walk through deploying a Python/Flask app to Heroku.
