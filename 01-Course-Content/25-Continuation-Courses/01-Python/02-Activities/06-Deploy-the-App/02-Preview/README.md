The goal for this lesson is to deploy the app to Heroku, so users can visit Just Tech News on a public URL, like just-tech-news.herokuapp.com.

Deploying can be broken up into the following steps:

1. Prepare the local files for deployment.

2. Set up the Heroku app.

These steps might not seem like a lot, given your previous experience with Node.js apps, but there are still some Python specifics to take into account.
