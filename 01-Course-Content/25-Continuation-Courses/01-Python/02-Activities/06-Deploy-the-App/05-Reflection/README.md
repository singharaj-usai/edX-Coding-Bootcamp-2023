# Reflection

Congratulations on deploying your first Python/Flask app. You successfully built a web server that can withstand the stresses of a production environment. All the error handling and database rollbacks have finally paid off.

In this lesson, you accomplished the following:

* Saved your project dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file.

* Configured Heroku by using Gunicorn to run Flask.

Looking back at the module as a whole, you also accomplished the following:

* Set up a virtual environment for Python by using the venv module.

* Defined functions and classes by using Python syntax.

* Created and imported Python packages and modules.

* Used the Flask library to create GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.

* Created MySQL tables by using the SQLAlchemy ORM.

* Queried a database by using SQLAlchemy methods.

* Handled errors by using `assert` and `try...except` statements.

* Used the contextual `g` and `session` objects of Flask across routes.

* Imported custom filter functions into Jinja templates.

* Created custom decorator functions.

Along the way, you've uncovered many differences and similarities between Python and JavaScript. Have you noticed that the differences are mostly syntactical? Concepts like servers, requests, templates, models, conditionals, and errors remain the same across different languages. If you understand those core concepts, then you can learn any new programming language—just identify a specific feature that you want to build using that language, and search online for resources that can guide you through the process.

And when you do learn a new language, practice is crucial! To practice Python, you can build another Flask web app from scratch or look into uses like scripting or software development. Whatever you choose, now you're equipped to tackle any potential obstacles. Good luck!
