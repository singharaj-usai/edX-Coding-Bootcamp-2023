# Introduction

By now, you've explored full-stack web development and several front-end and back-end tech stacks. And, you've explored the inner workings of JavaScript execution, performant web applications, the internet itself, and more.

We could easily stop there. But these days, the internet has become embedded in how we find new customers and interact with them. Companies thus need more than a website—they need a way to consistently, reliably, and economically deliver that website to consumers. So in this module, we'll examine how cloud computing has solved this problem—and caused a paradigm shift in how companies deliver web solutions to consumers.

We'll be working with an application called "Deep Thoughts," which allows users to post their thoughts. It uses MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, which makes it a MERN application. We'll deploy this app to the cloud and replace the back-end API with cloud resources to handle the storage, database, and computing.

We've chosen AWS to fulfill this role. We chose AWS over other providers, like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform, because AWS is currently the most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform. AWS offers the widest range of web services, a vast array of customers (from startups to enterprises), and an extensive free tier. We'll use AWS throughout this course.

**Note**

> To integrate with AWS, you'll need to create an AWS account, which requires a credit card. However, you won't be charged any fees, because you'll use the free tier, which is available for a year. You'll also learn how to set up notifications for billing changes and how to protect your account. Additionally, you will be creating and using a private GitHub repository so that your repository is not searchable or open to the public.

The following image shows an example of the deployed Deep Thoughts application:

`A screenshot depicts three cards, each containing a user post that includes the date, the time, and an image.`

In this lesson, we'll explain the economics of cloud computing, set up an AWS account, analyze the core services that AWS makes available, and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) with access keys.

Remember that a solid grasp of emerging technologies can help you stand out to job recruiters! Learning new technologies and skills is crucial for solving the kinds of problems that web developers and IT administrators face every day.
