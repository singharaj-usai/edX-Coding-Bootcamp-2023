The goals of this lesson are to introduce AWS as a cloud services provider and to set up our Deep Thoughts project in AWS.

To get there, we’ll follow this game plan:

1. Set up the project.

2. Introduce cloud computing.

3. Set up an AWS account (including billing preferences and security).

4. Explore AWS services (particularly those on the free tier).

5. Create and access an Amazon S3 bucket.

**Note**

> The front-end code for this project will be provided so that we can focus on the necessary permissions and connection patterns for integrating AWS.

Let's get started!
