# Explore AWS Services

In the previous step, we set up an AWS account. In this step, we'll explore AWS services.

Let's return to the AWS Management Console to explore the services that are available to us. To do so, select the AWS logo in the top-left menu bar.

Now let's examine the AWS services available by expanding the "All services" item under "AWS Services". You can see that a wide selection of services are available. The categories include Developer Tools, Databases, Machine Learning, Storage, Compute, Internet of Things (IoT), and much more.

In this module, we'll focus on the following three categories of services:

* The **Compute** category offers services that allow computer systems to be provisioned to run applications, calculate complex calculations, and respond to requests.

* The **Storage** category offers services that store data in the cloud.

* The **Database** category includes relational and non-relational databases that can be used to store and query large amounts of data.

**Important**

> Although these services seem pretty ordinary, they are built for scalability. For example, unlike a storage device like DropBox or iCloud, S3 can handle up to 5,500 requests per second. The S3 database services are also built to scale exponentially without losing any performance.

As you explore these categories, you'll notice that they contain several types of services from which to choose. This might seem incredibly daunting due to the breadth of options. You'll soon find that the services in each category actually have many similarities, with some slight variations.

**Important**

> For every web service that AWS offers, there is a console for that service. We can interface and manage the service through the console to check permissions or view the status or data.

## Amazon S3

As a case in point, let's look at the Storage service category. Amazon **S3**, which stands for **Simple Storage Service**, was one of the original services that AWS launched in 2006. S3 provides 5 GB of memory in the Free Tier, and it stores files on their computing systems, which you can access if you have the correct permissions. These files can be accessed anywhere with a convenient link for downloading. Often referred to as an **S3 bucket**, this storage resource can handle many requests per second.

Another service, Amazon **S3 Glacier**, is designed for long-term storage. Downloads take longer (sometimes hours), but this service is much less expensive. The main distinction of S3 Glacier is the availability and speed at which we can access the stored files.

For our purposes, we'll use an S3 bucket.
