# Reflection

You did a great job of completing a conceptual lesson that also contained lots of setup and configuration! The latter part was vital to protect the source code, the data, and the account itself.

In this lesson, you accomplished the following:

* Explained the economics of cloud computing.

* Set up an AWS account.

* Analyzed the core services that AWS makes available.

* Configured the AWS CLI with access keys.

Now that we created an S3 bucket, we'll use it to store static files after we set up the database. The next step will be to model the data—so that AWS can reproduce the back-end operations for storing and querying user data.
