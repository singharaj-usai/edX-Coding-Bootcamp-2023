# Reflection

You learned a lot during this lesson about working with a local DynamoDB instance! You used a large-scale-first approach, which enables an application to scale up without degrading the performance. In this scenario, the cloud provider maintains the database service with reliability, availability, durability, and security. You can thus focus on the application features instead of worrying about applying security patches, calculating capacity, designing the IT architecture, and buying equipment.

In this lesson, you accomplished the following:

* Created a data model for the application.

* Created and populated a table by using DynamoDB.

* Read and wrote data to the database.

* Queried a table in a NoSQL database.

* Created API endpoints

* Programmatically connected to AWS.

In the next lesson, we'll integrate the API endpoints with the client. The user will then be able to interact with the database—to display data and to post data to the database. We'll also add a new feature so that we can use images in the Deep Thoughts application.
