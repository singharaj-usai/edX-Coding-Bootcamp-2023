# Reflection

You've now completed another lesson that was full of new skills and concepts! These included integrating database calls and form data requests into the application. You used React Hooks to connect the UI components to database calls for the purpose of retrieving data from the `Thoughts` table. Then, you created the image upload route to upload an image to the S3 bucket.

**On The Job**

> In the AWS ecosystem, working with multiple web services is a typical expectation. The ability to add features that highlight different services contributes to making AWS highly customizable and flexible. And with the pay-as-you-go model, you can use the AWS infrastructure without large up-front cost commitments—giving you an affordable way to try new services.

In this lesson, you accomplished the following:

* Integrated database calls into the UI.

* Created an image upload route for uploading an image to the S3 bucket.

* Added an input element to capture the image file from the user.

* Integrated the image upload route into the UI component.

In the next and final lesson of this module, we'll put the finishing touches on the Deep Thoughts application. Specifically, we'll modify the existing database calls to store the image attribute. We'll then render the image in the Deep Thoughts application by modifying the `ThoughtList` UI component. Finally, we'll deploy the application to a virtual machine in the cloud.
