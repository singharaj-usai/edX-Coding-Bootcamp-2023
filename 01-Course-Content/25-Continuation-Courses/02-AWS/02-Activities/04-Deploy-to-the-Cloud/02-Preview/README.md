The goals of this lesson are twofold. First, we'll complete the image feature so that it can render the images from the S3 bucket. Second, we'll make this application publicly available in the AWS cloud.

The following image shows an example of what we'll build by the end of the lesson:

`A screenshot depicts the Deep Thoughts homepage, which displays users' images along with their thoughts.`

To get there, we’ll follow this game plan:

1. Display the images.

2. Modify the UI components to render the images.

3. Learn about AWS virtual machines. (VMs)

4. Create an EC2 instance.

5. Set up the EC2 environment.

6. Install the application environment dependencies.

7. Configure the NGINX server.

8. Modify the API calls.

9. Build and run a production version of the application.

Let's get started!
