# Reflection

You did a great job of working through a dense lesson about environment setup and server configuration! Deployment can be a lengthy process. By working through it in this lesson, you should have gained some understanding of the decisions that involve resource allocation, security access, and server configurations.

Now, you can design a VM that's customized to resource types—specifically, those types that an application needs to process requests and store data. Completing this initial setup eases replicating an AMI image to other EC2 instances.

**On The Job**

> We've significantly reduced the time that we'd need to scale up the application if demand rose beyond the capacity of the EC2 instance. For an on-premises deployment, we'd need lots more time and capital to purchase a server and implement it in the network.

In this lesson, you accomplished the following:

* Modified the database queries to include the image attribute.

* Modified the UI components to render images.

* Launched an EC2 instance.

* Set up the EC2 environment.

* Cloned the application to the EC2 instance.

* Deployed the web application to AWS.

## Module Recap

Looking back at the module as a whole, you learned how to:

* Explain the economics of cloud computing.

* Set up an AWS account.

* Analyze the core services that AWS makes available.

* Configure the AWS CLI with access keys.

* Create a data model for the application.

* Create and populate a table by using DynamoDB.

* Read and write data to the database.

* Query a table in a NoSQL database.

* Create API endpoints.

* Programmatically connect to AWS.

* Integrate database calls into the UI.

* Create an image upload route for uploading an image to the S3 bucket.

* Add an input element to capture the image file from the user.

* Integrate the image upload route into the UI component.

* Modify the database queries to include the image attribute.

* Modify the UI components to render images.

* Launch an EC2 instance.

* Set up the EC2 environment.

* Clone the application to the EC2 instance.

* Deploy the web application to AWS.

With the advanced skills that you learned in this module, you're now prepared to deploy an application that's both globally available and performant. This application could also quickly scale to handle thousands of concurrent users—if the need arose. The ability to use a vast infrastructure to reach millions of consumers in a relatively short amount of time is an incredible feat of modern internet technology.

As web technology continues to advance at a remarkable rate, new solutions continue to emerge. Understanding cloud computing will enable you to stay on the cutting edge of technology and demonstrate your willingness to continue learning about advanced technological solutions.
