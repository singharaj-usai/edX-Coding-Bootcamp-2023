# Intro to Java

## Java

In this course, you’ll refactor an existing web application called Just Tech News to use Java and Thymeleaf for the front end and template engine, respectively, instead of Node.js and Handlebars.js. You’ll also use the Spring framework to build a web server and to model and interact with a relational database. When you're done, you’ll deploy your app to the cloud using Heroku.

Refactoring Just Tech News will give you a chance to work with Java and some of its more popular frameworks and tools. According to GitHub, Java is one of the most popular programming languages, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. This is due in large part to its platform independency: Java programs can run on many types of machines—including laptops, data centers, game consoles, and scientific supercomputers—as long as there is a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in place.

Java is the #1 programming language when it comes to job openings, and it’s easy to understand why. It can be used to build a wide array of software, from comprehensive business systems to desktop software to mobile applications. It’s frequently used in financial services, e-commerce, data visualization, and distributed systems. It’s also the language behind many widely used software and development tools such as Eclipse, NetBeans IDE, and IntelliJ Idea.

While more verbose than JavaScript, its syntax is considered to be straightforward, and it comes with a library of classes that offer commonly used utility functions for most Java programs. Java is backwards-compatible with older versions, which makes it ideal for large codebases, and its standardized naming conventions make it easy to read and pick up by other developers. It also has the benefit of having been around for a relatively long time, meaning that there is an enormous ecosystem of high-quality tools and other Java developers to rely on.

Just like most other popular programming languages, Java has several frameworks that make it easier to develop applications. The most popular Java framework is Spring, but you might encounter others such as Struts, Grails, Hibernate, Play, and Dropwizard. For the project in this course, you’ll use Spring.
