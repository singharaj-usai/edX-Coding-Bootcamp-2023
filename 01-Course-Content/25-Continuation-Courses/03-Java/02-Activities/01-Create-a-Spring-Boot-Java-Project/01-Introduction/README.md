# Introduction

At this point, you've learned several back-end development technologies, including the following:

* Node.js—a JavaScript runtime environment

* Express.js—a library that facilitates web server features in Node.js

* Sequelize—an ORM that helps to abstract database tables as models

* Handlebars.js—a template engine for delivering HTML and data together

These technologies all form part of the JavaScript ecosystem, but not every company uses JavaScript for their back-end needs. For example, Java—an alternative to Node.js and Express.js—has long been the most popular programming language for enterprise-level applications.

You'll likely interact with a Java API at some point in your development career. When you do, you'll find that the open source Spring framework provides useful support for Java-based applications, thanks to a robust programming and configuration model.

Spring Boot offers autoconfiguration of the Spring framework, enabling us to select prepackaged dependency bundles that provide all of the Java libraries necessary to build a stand-alone, production-ready API capable of deployment to the cloud. This streamlined process helps empower development teams to create microservices, which break down large applications into smaller suites of services.

In this module, you'll experience the benefits of Spring Boot firsthand as you code the back end of a social news website. You've built something like this before, including capabilities for users to create accounts, post links to interesting articles, and upvote or comment on other users' posts.

The difference is that this time, we'll use the following Java-based technologies in place of MERN:

* Spring Boot will replace Node.js and Express.js.

* Spring Data JPA will replace Sequelize.js.

* Thymeleaf will replace Handlebars.js.

* Spring Session will replace Express Session.

That's a lot of new tools! But the general concepts used across both Java and JavaScript are actually similar, which will make it easier for you to accomplish the goals in this lesson.
