# Install Your Software

For your first foray into Java, you'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a code editor.

Although we've used code editors before, we'll need something bigger and better for the purposes of this lesson. VS Code and Sublime work fine for simpler languages like JavaScript, but Java requires a bona fide **integrated development environment (IDE)**. An IDE is a robust code editor with a built-in compiler and debugger. We'll use IntelliJ IDEA, one of the most popular IDEs in the industry.

You'll also use MySQL Workbench and POSTMan, but these should already be installed because you've used them before. For installing the JDK and IntelliJ IDEA, refer to the installation guide for your operating system (macOS or Windows).
