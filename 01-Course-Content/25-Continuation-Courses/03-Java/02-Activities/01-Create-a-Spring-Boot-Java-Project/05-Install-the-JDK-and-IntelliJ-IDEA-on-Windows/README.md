# Install the JDK and IntelliJ IDEA on Windows

To install the JDK and IntelliJ IDEA on your Windows computer, make sure to follow the instructions closely! Each step must be completed exactly as described in order for the installations to work.

In order to install the Java programming language, you need the JDK. But first you must [create an Oracle account](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/get-oracle-com-account.html). When you have an account with Oracle, complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [JDK downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

2. Select the "Windows x86" download option.

3. Click the user agreement and scroll to the bottom, then check the box accepting the agreement.

4. Sign in to your Oracle account.

5. Run the install file.

6. On the first setup page, click Install, as shown in the following image:

7. Select the install path and click next.

8. On the "Change in License Terms" page, click OK.

9. Once again, choose the installation directory.

10. Click Next. When the Complete page appears, you've successfully installed Java!

7. Click Install.

8. Choose your preferred option for when to reboot.

9. Once you've rebooted, launch IntelliJ.
