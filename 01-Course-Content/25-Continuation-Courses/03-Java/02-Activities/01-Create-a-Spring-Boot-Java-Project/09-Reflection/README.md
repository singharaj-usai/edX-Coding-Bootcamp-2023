# Reflection

Congratulations on taking the first step toward creating this Java API! You've constructed the foundation of the news app, so now you'll be able to incrementally build each module of the project. Then you can integrate these modules with the back-end database and the front-end user-facing templates.

In this lesson, you've achieved the following tasks:

* Installed project support software.

* Created the Spring Boot project with Spring Initializr.

* Imported the project and created the project root folder.

* Set up a new GitHub repository.

* Connected the project to the GitHub repository.

* Connected IntelliJ to the project root folder and noted the project folder structure.

* Manually added Thymeleaf Layout Dialect, Spring Session JDBC, and Spring Security Core dependencies to the project from MVNRepository.

Next, you'll create the entity model classes that the Spring Data JPA will use to create the database tables supporting the API. Keep up the hard work!
