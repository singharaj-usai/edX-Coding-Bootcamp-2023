# Introduction

At this point, you've installed essential software, created your Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer, imported the project, and connected it to GitHub and IntelliJ. Phew! That was a lot of setup, but now that you've created your Java development environment, you can actually start writing Java code.

This project involves building a Java back end to support an existing front end for a social news website. Remember, in back-end development, it is crucial to ensure proper database setup, successful table creation, and effective table relationships. So our first step is to create the Java classes that will become the application's entity models—which will then be converted into database tables.

You'll learn how to do the following:

* Create variables with data-type definitions and private access.

* Implement public getter and setter methods.

* Generate constructor functions for instance variables by using IntelliJ.

* Leverage Spring by using annotations.

Much like we've done before, we'll use the MySQL database for this project. But because we're working with Java now, we'll use Spring Data JPA for the ORM instead of Sequelize.
