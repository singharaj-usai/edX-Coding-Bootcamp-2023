The primary goal for this lesson is to start setting up the database for Just Tech News, by building the entity model classes. These entity model classes will form the database table definitions that will be generated by the Spring Data JPA.

In the process, you'll explore a lot of Java fundamentals, including **class creation**, **method creation**, and **encapsulation**. You'll also learn the importance of the Spring framework and how annotations facilitate functionality by telling the Spring Data JPA how to define and create the tables in the database.

IntelliJ IDEA can do a lot of heavy lifting for us when it comes to creating classes. We'll start with some example classes and then move on to create the entity model classes!

To achieve the goals for this lesson, we'll tackle the following steps:

1. Create a "Hello, World!" program in Java and practice making demo entity models.

2. Create the `User` entity model for the database.

3. Create the `Post` entity model.

4. Create the `Comment` entity model.

5. Create the `Vote` entity model.
