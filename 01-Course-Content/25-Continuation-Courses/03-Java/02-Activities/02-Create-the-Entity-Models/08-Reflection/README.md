# Reflection

The most exciting portion of development for this API is yet to come, but what we accomplished in this lesson was no less important. Just like building a house, we need to build a secure and solid foundation before we can make it look pretty.

To that end, in this lesson you learned how to do the following:

* Create a Java class.

* Create a Java method.

* Identify the important structural parts of a method.

* Create Java entity model classes.

* Add Spring annotations to the entity model classes, allowing Spring Data JPA to create the database and the database tables.

With that foundation in place, now we can create database repository interfaces, start the Java API, and spin up the database! We'll tackle all of that next.
