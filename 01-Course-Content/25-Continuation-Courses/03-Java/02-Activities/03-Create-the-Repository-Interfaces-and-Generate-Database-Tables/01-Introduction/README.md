# Introduction

Congratulations on creating and annotating the entity model classes for the Java API! That probably seemed like a lot of code with no real payoff, but you've laid the foundation for your next step. Those entity models will become the database tables, and all the annotations and code you wrote will dictate their structure.

Now we'll create repository interfaces for each of the model classes. Once those are in place, we'll start up the Java API for the first time—and observe how Spring Data JPA automatically generates the database tables and table relationships based on the entity models we created.

Throughout this lesson, we'll learn how to do the following:

* Create a repository interface.

* Implement CRUD functionality by using Spring Data JPA alongside SQL.

* Create custom SQL queries to address any additional database operation needs.

* Write manual SQL queries to use in the Spring Data JPA framework.

* Configure the database.

* Configure Spring Sessions.

* Start the Java API.

* Confirm database creation via MySQL Workbench.

Next let's preview how we'll approach this lesson.
