The goal for this lesson is to create the repository interfaces for the entity models we created in the previous lesson. This step will provide the necessary connectivity, mapping, and translations between the database tables and the Java entity model objects. We'll then configure the MySQL database connection to work with the Java API. At that point, we'll start up the API to confirm that the database tables have been created with the expected columns and table relationships.

To achieve all this, we'll complete the following steps:

1. Create the repository interfaces for the entity models.

2. Configure the data source, Spring Session, and port number for the API.

3. Start up the database.

4. Confirm successful database table creation.

Let's get started!
