# Introduction

You've learned a serious amount of foundational Java concepts so far. You've created entity models and repository interfaces, and you've configured your database and Spring Session—allowing you to actually run your Java API. And thanks to all of that up-front work, your database, tables, and relationships were all created when you ran the API for the first time!

Now we'll create the server-side CRUD controllers. When we talk about **controllers** in Spring Boot Java, we're referring to how we'll process requests and responses both to and from the API. This concept is comparable to routes in Express.js, but the execution will differ in Java. The controllers that we create will manage the processing flow of the API.

* Create the CRUD REST controllers that receive incoming data, process the transaction, and respond to that request.

* Manage the API routing through REST and the Spring `@RestController` classes.

* Test out new API endpoints with Insomnia.

Now let's look at the plan for creating this crucial piece of the Just Tech News API.
