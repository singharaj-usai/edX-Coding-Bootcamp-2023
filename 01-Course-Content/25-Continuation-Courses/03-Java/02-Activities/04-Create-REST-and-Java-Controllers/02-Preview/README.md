The goal for this lesson is to create the controllers that will manage the server-side CRUD commands. We'll create the `UserController`, `PostController`, and `CommentController`, using class-level and method-level annotations. We'll apply the RESTful standards that we've already learned and use Insomnia to test transactions and the CRUD controllers.

To accomplish all this, we'll complete the following steps:

1. Create the `UserController`.

2. Create the `PostController`.

3. Create the `CommentController`.

4. Create Insomnia JSON/REST test transactions for the CRUD controllers.

Time to write some code!
