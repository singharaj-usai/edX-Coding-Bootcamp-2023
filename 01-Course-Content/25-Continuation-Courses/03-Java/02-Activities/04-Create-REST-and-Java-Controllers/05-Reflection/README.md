# Reflection

We're making fantastic progress creating a Java API for the Just Tech News website. At this point we have a functioning API that's capable of starting up and connecting to the database; we can also interact with it, by sending Insomnia JSON requests. We created controllers that will receive, process, and route request transactions. Furthermore, we can validate that the routing and processing works properly for each of those test transactions.

In this lesson, you've successfully completed the following tasks:

* Created the CRUD REST controllers that are critical to receiving incoming data and then processing the transaction and responding appropriately to that request.

* Managed the API routing through REST and the Spring `@RestController` controller classes.

Next, we'll create the Thymeleaf templates—an exciting portion of building the API that involves direct interaction with the user!
