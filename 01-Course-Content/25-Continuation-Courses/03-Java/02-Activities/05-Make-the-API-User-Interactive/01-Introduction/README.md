# Introduction

Congratulations on creating the server-side CRUD controllers and testing those controllers with Insomnia test transactions! We'll use these CRUD controllers as we continue working on the API—which is now fully functional, processing incoming requests and responding with outgoing responses. The next step to this project, then, is making the API not just functional but interactive.

You'll accomplish this with the help of HTML templates, which will serve as an interface to users. Remember, a **template** is an HTML page that combines standard HTML tags with language-specific style statements and objects, all to be included in the construction and presentation of the page to the end user. This tool will allow your application to receive data from the user and populate data on the page, a critical function of an API.

Templates and template engines should already be familiar to you from your previous work with Handlebars.js. For this project, you'll use the Thymeleaf template engine, but the overall concept is the same.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Implement the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect.

* Add a CSS style sheet for HTML templates.

* Explain the structure of a Thymeleaf template.

* Create main templates with Thymeleaf.

* Explain that Java objects can be passed in and out of template pages.

* Implement the template syntax necessary to display data, retrieve data, and collect data.

* Create a Thymeleaf form in a template.

* Create and use Thymeleaf template fragments to represent template code that's repeated in multiple places in the API.

* Explain how the date format helper, the plural words helper, and the URL format helper can assist with making displays consistent.
