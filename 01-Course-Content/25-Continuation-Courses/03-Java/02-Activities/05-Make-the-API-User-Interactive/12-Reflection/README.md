# Reflection

Wow, you tackled a lot of new code and created a lot of files in this lesson! Assembling the template pages can take a lot of work, but this is the step that makes an API truly interactive.

In this lesson you've successfully completed the following:

* Created templates for the homepage, login page, dashboard, and more.

* Created Thymeleaf fragments, including `post-fragment.html` and `comment-fragment.html`, to be used in multiple places in the API, reducing code duplication.

* Created JavaScript files—like `upvote.js` and `delete-post.js`—that will assist with data gathering and making calls internally to endpoints within the API.

In the next lesson, we'll create the template controllers that will manage the flow as well as the processing of the API, supplying the user with responses that they need and expect. This project is finally nearing completion!
