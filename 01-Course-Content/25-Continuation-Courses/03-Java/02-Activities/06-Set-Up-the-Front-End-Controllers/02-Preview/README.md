The goal for this lesson is to set up the front-end control flow. The code we write here will dictate which templates and fragments are shown to users, and when they're shown to them. This flow can make or break the user experience.

We'll take the following steps to achieve this goal:

1. Create the `HomePageController` and its associated endpoints.

2. Test the `HomePageController`.

3. Create the `TechNewsController` and its associated endpoints.

4. Test the `TechNewsController`.
