# Reflection

Congratulations on completing the Java Tech News API! You've built a highly functional and useful API with Java, Spring, and Thymeleaf. You've learned how to build an API in a modular fashion from the ground up starting with the foundation and completing in this lesson the functional management and interactivity management with the API users.

In this lesson you've successfully completed the following:

* Created the `HomePageController` that manages the entry and exit of the user into and out of the API.

* Created the `TechNewsController` that manages the internal API processing calls for the many requests that a user can make to the API, as well as the display and retrieval of data to and from the user.

Feel free to keep tinkering with your newly finished Java API! You can revisit parts of the build process that gave you trouble the first time around, and you can consult supplemental resources as you continue to familiarize yourself with Java. But for now, you should be proud of what you've accomplished.

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to deploy to Heroku, making this API available for use by anyone who knows the address!
