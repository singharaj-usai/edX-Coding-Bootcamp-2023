# Introduction

You've already achieved a lot just by building a local version of Just Tech News! However, in its current state, the API can only be accessed by you or someone with a zipped version for download. You should make it available more widely, so that potential employers can see your coding skills on display.

In this lesson, you'll remedy that, by deploying your API to the Heroku cloud platform! You'll learn how to do the following:

* Create a new application dashboard on Heroku.

* Add a free MySQL database to your Heroku account and bind that database to a Java API.

* Connect an API's GitHub repository to the Heroku platform so that you can deploy to the cloud directly from the repository.

* Deploy a Java API to Heroku.

You'll learn some useful skills along the way, but it should be a pretty straightforward process.
