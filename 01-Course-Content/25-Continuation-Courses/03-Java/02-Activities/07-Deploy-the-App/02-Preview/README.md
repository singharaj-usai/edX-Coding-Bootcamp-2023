The only goal for this lesson is to deploy your new Java API to the web so that anyone can access and interact with it. You'll take the following steps to accomplish that task:

1. Create the application dashboard on Heroku.

2. Add ClearDB MySQL to the application on Heroku.

3. Connect Heroku to the GitHub repository.

4. Deploy the API!

This won't take long, so let's get started!
