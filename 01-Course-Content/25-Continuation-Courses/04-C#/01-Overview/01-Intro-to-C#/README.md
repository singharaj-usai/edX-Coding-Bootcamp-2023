# Intro to C#

## C#

In this course, you’ll use C# to build a command-line application that creates security badges for a rapidly expanding startup named CatWorx. You’ll also use Microsoft’s .NET framework to import libraries that allow you to read and write to the file system, query APIs, and generate images.

C# (pronounced see sharp) is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that was designed with enterprise applications in mind. Interestingly, it was created by Microsoft in 2000 because the company that owned Java at the time did not want Microsoft to make changes to that language. C# can be thought of as a hybrid language that takes the best of the programming languages C and C++ to create a truly modern and flexible language.

C# has been steadily rising in popularity, thanks in part to its wide array of use cases, holding a spot in the top-five most popular programming languages in the world. It enjoys widespread community support, due in part to backing from Microsoft and its Azure cloud platform. It’s also a statically-typed language, which means that data types must be explicitly declared and the code is checked for errors before it’s turned into an application. This makes it easier for developers to spot errors.

C# is used in a variety of ways, including the creation of desktop, web, and mobile applications, with built-in support for Android and iPhone with Xamarin. Paired with the .NET framework, it’s also a common choice for configuring web servers. In addition to all of these use cases, one of its most popular uses is to create games with the Unity game engine, which is the most popular game engine in the world. More than a third of the top games are made with Unity, and there are approximately 770 million active users of games created using the Unity engine.

.NET Core is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for the Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, and it’s the cross-platform successor to the .NET Framework that ran primarily on Windows. You’ll use .NET to access additional tools and libraries, and it will also provide a runtime environment that can interpret C#.
