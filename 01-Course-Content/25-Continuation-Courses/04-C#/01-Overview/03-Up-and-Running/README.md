# Up and Running

## Getting Ready

This section contains a list of the tools you’ll use in this module. You don’t need to install them before you begin—you’ll do that during the lessons.

You’ll use the following tools in this module:

* The [C# Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) is an extension that provides lightweight development tools for .NET Core, C# editing support, and debugging support for .NET Core.

* The [NET Core SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/sdk) will install everything you need to build and run C# applications, including libraries, tools, and the .NET runtime environment. This includes the **dotnet** application, which will allow you to install packages, called **assemblies**, and run C# applications from the command line.

* [Place Kitten](https://placekitten.com/) is a quick and simple service for getting pictures of kittens for use as placeholders in your designs or code. You’ll use Place Kitten to provide a placeholder image for the security badges that your application creates before you start working with randomly generated user data.

* [SkiaSharp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp?view=skiasharp-2.80.2) is a .NET package that provides access to graphics functionality. You’ll use this package to modify and manipulate the graphics for the security badges using C#.

* The [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/documentation) is a free, open-source API for generating random user data. You’ll use this API to create user data, such as names, ids, and thumbnail photos, for the security badges that your application creates.

* You’ll use the [Newtonsoft.Json package](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/Introduction.htm) to access the Json.NET framework, which lets you parse the JSON data that you get from the Random User Generator API.

* macOS users will use the [mono-libgdiplus package](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/libgdiplus/) to add an assembly needed to parse the JSON data that you get from the Random User Generator API. Window users already have this assembly natively.
