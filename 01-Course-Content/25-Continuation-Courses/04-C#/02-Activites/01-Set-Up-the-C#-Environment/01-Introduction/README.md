# Set Up the C# Environment

For many developers looking to expand their skill sets, C# is a natural next step. This object-oriented programming language from Microsoft is closely related to many other programming languages—making it easier to learn. It's also the perfect choice if you want to develop games or Microsoft applications.

In this module, you’ll use C# to build a console app that creates employee security badges for a rapidly expanding startup, CatWorx. You’ll use the .NET framework to import libraries that let you read and write to the file system, query APIs, and generate images.

Before you get started, you need to set up an environment that can build and run C# applications. You'll use VS Code, which you should already have set up from working with JavaScript. And because you already have VS Code installed, enabling it to write, debug, and build C# projects is just a two-step process.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Set up a C# environment.

* Run a C# application.

* Declare a statically typed variable.

* Distinguish between JavaScript and C# syntax.
