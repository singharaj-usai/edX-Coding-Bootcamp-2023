# Add the C# Extension

First things first—let’s add the C# extension by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the Extensions panel in VS Code, then search for C#. Alternatively, you can view extensions by using the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+X (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows).

2. Add the C# extension by OmniSharp. It should be near the top of the list and resemble the following image:

`A description of C# for Visual Studio Code notes that the extension is powered by OmniSharp.`

That's all there is to it! Next, we'll install .NET Core.
