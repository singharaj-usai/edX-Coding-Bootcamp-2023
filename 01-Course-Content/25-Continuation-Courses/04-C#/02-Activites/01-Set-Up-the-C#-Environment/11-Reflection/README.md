# Reflection

We've covered a lot in just one lesson, including many of the fundamental similarities and differences between C# and JavaScript. At this point, we've discovered some of what makes C# unique.

In this lesson, you learned how to do the following:

* Set up a C# environment.

* Run a C# application.

* Declare a statically typed variable.

* Use C# data types like strings, numbers, arrays and lists, dictionaries, and Booleans.

* Iterate using `for` loops.

That's a lot to learn in a short amount of time, but by leveraging your knowledge of OOP from JavaScript, you're well ahead of the curve. With these essential building blocks, you can start to build the security badge application and learn more about the utilitarian nature of C# and the .NET framework. You'll soon feel confident using C#’s assets to build simple programs!

Now that you have a basic understanding of the C# syntax, let’s explore how to interact with the user through the console.
