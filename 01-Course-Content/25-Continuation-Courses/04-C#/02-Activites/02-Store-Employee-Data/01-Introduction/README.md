# Introduction

Now that you've set up the development environment, you're ready to build on the C# fundamentals you've already picked up—by building a badge-making app! First, to contain the employee data, you'll need to use some of the data storage types you've examined already.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Interact with users via the command-line interface (CLI).

* Declare and call class methods.

* Create and instantiate a new class.

* Refactor the code along the way to keep the project organized, maintainable, and extensible.

Here's an overview of how we'll approach this:

1. Prompt the user and store their employee data.

2. Organize the code using methods with single responsibility.

3. Create a class to hold the employee objects.

4. Print the employee information.

Are you ready? Let's go!
