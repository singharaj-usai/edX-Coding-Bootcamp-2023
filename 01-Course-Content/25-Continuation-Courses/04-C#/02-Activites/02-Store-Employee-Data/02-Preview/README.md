The goal for this lesson is to set up the basic architecture of the CatWorx application and declare data types to store the employee data.

The following steps detail how we'll approach this lesson's tasks:

1. Get a single employee name by using `ReadLine()`.

2. Organize the code.

3. Create an `Employee` class with a name property.

4. Store the employee names.

5. Update the output logic.

6. Add remaining properties and methods to the `Employee` class.

7. Collect and print all employee property values.
