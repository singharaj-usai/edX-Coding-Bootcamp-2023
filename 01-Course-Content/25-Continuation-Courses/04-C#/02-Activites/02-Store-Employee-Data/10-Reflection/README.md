# Reflection

This was a big chunk of information, and we covered a lot of territory. Let's review what we've accomplished. In this lesson, we did the following:

* Interacted with users via the CLI.

* Declared and called class methods.

* Created and instantiated a new class.

* Refactored the code along the way to keep the project organized, maintainable, and extensible.

Hopefully you can see a lot of similarities between C# and JavaScript. And there are certainly a lot of differences, especially around C#'s strong type system and class syntax.

Okay, now it's time to start pumping out some security badges!
