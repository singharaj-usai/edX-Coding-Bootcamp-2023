The goal for this lesson is to complete the badge-maker application's first big feature: write employee data to a CSV file.

To accomplish this, we will follow these steps:

1. Clean up the code by using classes.

2. Pseudocode the steps.

3. Add a new method to `Util` and call it from `Program.cs`.

4. Check for and create the data folder.

5. Create the CSV file.

6. Loop over the employees and write the data.

Now let's follow these steps to implement this feature!
