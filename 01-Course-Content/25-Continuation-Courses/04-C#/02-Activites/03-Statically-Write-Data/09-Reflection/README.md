# Reflection

Now for a recap. In this lesson, we refactored the badge-maker app's code by adding another class whose methods were defined as static. One of those static methods used the `StreamWriter` class to write content to a file. We achieved the following tasks:

* Used `static` to keep code neatly organized.

* Populated a CSV file with `Util`.

* Managed memory with the `using` keyword.

Before you move on, take a few minutes to review the key concepts you've just learned. Specifically, what does the `static` modifier mean? And why was it necessary to wrap `StreamWriter` in a `using` statement?

As you move on to creating image files, you'll find that the syntax differs from what you've seen up till now. But you’re well prepared for the challenge if you’ve made it this far!
