# Introduction
By now you should be well aware that, in the beginning, much of your time spent building an application involves setting up the right environment, pseudocoding steps to help guide the workflow, and procuring resources or data for the testing process.

So far, that's what we've achieved for our badge-maker app. But now we’ve reached the point when we can create the security badges and deliver the end result!

In this lesson, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Use pseudocode to break down each step ahead of time and outline your workflow.

* Research and use classes and methods to manipulate images and text.

* Convert objects into more usable data types.

* Designate placement and size of images using `SKRect`.

* Create a new file with the `SaveTo()` method.
