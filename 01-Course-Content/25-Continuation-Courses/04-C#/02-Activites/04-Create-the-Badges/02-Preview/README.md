The goal in this lesson is to make the actual badges that we set out to create in the first place!

In order to do this, we'll proceed using the following steps:

1. Pseudocode the steps you'll take for this feature.

2. Create the `MakeBadges()` method in the `Util` class.

3. Import the `SkiaSharp` package to use its graphics tools to create the badge template.

4. Set up the badge template in the `MakeBadges()` method.

5. Build the badges by using the `HttpClient` class to insert employee data into the badge template.

6. Render the employee photo using the `SKBitmap` class.

7. Insert the image onto the badge by converting the `SKBitmap` into a `SKCanvas` object.

8. Print the employee's information on the badge.

Now let's get started.
