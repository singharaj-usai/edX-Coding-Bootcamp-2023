# Pseudocode the Steps
As always, let's start by identifying the key tasks and mapping out the right sequence of these tasks. We'll think in terms of specific actions or functional steps required.

Remember, the end goal is to produce a security badge that displays the employee picture, employee name, company name, and employee id number. That might seem like a lot, so let's break it down into smaller objectives building up to the overall goal.

To make one badge for one employee, you might pseudocode the following steps:

1. Import the badge template image file that will work as the background image.

2. Customize each employee's badge by adding information specific to each employee—namely, the employee's name, picture, and id number.

Add this new image file to the data folder.

That seems more manageable, right? In the next section, you'll start to work through these steps.
