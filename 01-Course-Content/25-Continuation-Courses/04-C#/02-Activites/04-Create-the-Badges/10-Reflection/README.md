# Reflection

You put in an amazing effort to accomplish this lesson's main objective: to create a C# application that creates employee id badges. CatWorx leadership will be extremely happy with your contribution to their efforts to automate the badge-creation process.

In this lesson, you accomplished the following major tasks:

* Used pseudocode to break down each step ahead of time and outline your workflow.

* Researched and used classes and methods to manipulate images and text.

* Converted objects into more usable data types.

* Designated placement and size of images using `SKRect`.

* Created a new file with the `SaveTo()` method.

In the next and final lesson, we'll wrap up this project. To simulate a database full of many employees without manually needing to enter them one by one, we'll use an open API.
