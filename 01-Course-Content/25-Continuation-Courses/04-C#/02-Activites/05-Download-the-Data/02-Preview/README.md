In this lesson, we make a request to an API in order to automate the badge-creation process.

To do this, we'll execute the following steps:

1. Generate employee data by using the Random User Generator API.

2. Pseudocode the steps.

3. Prepare the `PeopleFetcher` class.

4. Call the API.

5. Convert the JSON.

6. Create the employees.

7. Add the finishing touches.

Now that we have a plan, it's time to get started!
