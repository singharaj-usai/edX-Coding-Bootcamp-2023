# Reflection

You did a great job working through a dense lesson of concepts, syntax, and package installs. The application is now properly situated to receive a response from an API and produce security badges. You have successfully automated the badge creation process, and now CatWorx can spend more time focusing on their core products and services!

In this lesson, you completed the following tasks:

* Made a request to the Random User Generator API for employee data.

* Parsed the JSON response into C# data types.

* Created a separate badge for each employee.

Now that we've reached the end of this module, let's take a moment to reflect on some of the key tasks we accomplished using C#:

* Set up the development environment by installing a VS Code extension and the .NET Core SDK.

* Used namespaces to organize the code and import libraries from the .NET framework.

* Defined functions and classes by using C# syntax.

* Used the `System.IO` namespace to write to a CSV file.

* Imported the `SkiaSharp` package to use graphics tools to create the badge template background.

* Used the `HttpClient` class to insert employee data into the badge template.

Although many differences are evident between C# and JavaScript, there are also many similarities that reduced the learning curve, such as understanding and leveraging the object-oriented approach to programming.

With your newfound familiarity with C#, a new world of development possibilities has emerged. C# is exceptionally versatile. Along with the .NET framework and a few extensions, you can use it to create many different types of apps, including mobile, web, desktop, cloud, and even gaming. By adding C# to your skill set, you've added a modern general-purpose language known for its speed and reliability with a vast community of resources and developers (including the backing of Microsoft!), which ensures a long and successful development existence.
