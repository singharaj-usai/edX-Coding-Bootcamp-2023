## Mock Interviews Revisited
[Back to Course Index](../../README.md)

## Overview:

In this unit, we will look at how computer science relates to JavaScript in order to prepare you for the technical interview portion of the job interview, which every developer eventually faces. Some of these challanges may feel abstract and confusing at times -- part of this challange is to face these coding challenges in a mock interview context.


In this Mock Interview Day you will practice a mock interview with your peers. This will give you an opportunity to learn about the technical interview portion of the web-developer job interview process. 

You'll address topics that are foundational to improving code performance and commonly found in technical interviews.

Review the code drills from our Computer Science Module to best prepare for this session.
