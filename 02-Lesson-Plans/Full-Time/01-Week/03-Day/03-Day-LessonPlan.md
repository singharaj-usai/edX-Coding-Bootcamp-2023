# 01.3 Full-Time Lesson Plan: HTML, CSS, and Git and Advanced CSS

## Overview

In today's class, students will wrap up Module 01 by collaborating on a mini-project that reinforces HTML and CSS fundamentals. Then students will start Module 02 by implementing media queries and flexbox to create a responsive web design.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete the `22-Stu_Mini-Project` in Module 01 and activities `01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen` through `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement` in Module 02.

* Module 01 mini-project builds on the fundamental HTML and CSS concepts that students learned this week. Encourage students to review previous activities for help with syntax and for further study.

* Reassure students that they are not expected to complete the mini-project in the allotted time and instead encourage them to define their own manageable scope of work as a group, while working to complete as much as they can.

* Although students will work on individual projects for the mini-project, they will be put into groups. Encourage them to brainstorm together and share their learnings. This will be the first of many opportunities for students to collaborate and work in groups.

* This mini-project might also be some students' first experience building a development project from scratch. Remind them to break down the project into small, manageable steps and to let both the user story and acceptance criteria guide them to a step-by-step solution.

* The activities of Module 02 use `max-width` over `min-width` for media query breakpoints. This is because it's simpler to introduce responsive breakpoints with a "desktop-first" approach.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions or to walk through the solution line by line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module, for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to do the following:

* Implement basic media queries for screens.

* Implement a CSS grid to accomplish a complex layout.

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive web design.

* Use flexbox justification and alignment properties for spacing.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Demo: Mini Project (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Each mini-project is an opportunity for you to implement what you learned in that module and work with a group to create an application in class.

  * Reassure students that they are not expected to complete the project in the allotted time and instead encourage them to define their own manageable scope of work as a group, while working to complete as much as they can.

  * üîë For the first mini-project, you will be creating a landing page using HTML and CSS. Each of you will work on your own landing page. However, you will still be put into groups so that you can brainstorm and work together through the specifications of the mini-project.

  * üîë The landing page will have a contact form.

  * üîë The landing page will have a header, footer, and an image.

  * üîë The landing page should also use semantic HTML and be accessible.

  * Be creative! You can choose your own colors, text, and image.

  * üîë You might need to do a bit of research on your own! As in real life, you will not always be given everything you need to complete a task. Developers have to be able to research and find their own answers.

  * When you approach a complex coding problem like this, break down the challenge into manageable chunks. Work with your group to figure out the steps to complete this mini-project.

  * üîë You should also refer frequently to the user story and acceptance criteria. Checking your work against the goal stated in the user story and the conditions established in the acceptance criteria is a great way to stay on track.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will use HTML to build the structure and use CSS to style the page.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini-project.

### 2. Student Do: Mini Project (60 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Module 01 Mini-Project: Landing Page

  In this mini-project, you will build a landing page using HTML and CSS. While you will be responsible for your own landing page, you will work in a group to brainstorm and share ideas.

  ## User Story

  Work in your group to implement the following user stories:

  * As a client, I want to view a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the page uses semantic HTML elements.

  * It's done when the page uses universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.

  * It's done when the page features at least three colors in the design.

  * It's done when the page uses a single font and font family for all text.

  * It's done when the page uses at least two heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`).

  * It's done when the header is fixed to the top of the page on scroll.

  * It's done when the header contains a navigation bar with three links that display inline, including a contact link.

  * It's done when, if the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.

  * It's done when the contact form includes `input` elements for name and email.

  * It's done when the contact form includes a Send button.

  * It's done when the image includes a descriptive `alt` attribute.

  * It's done when the page is deployed to GitHub Pages.

  ## üí° Notes

  Follow these instructions to deploy your project to GitHub Pages:

  1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

  2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

  3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

  4. On the Settings page, select Pages on the left side of the page. On the GitHub Pages screen, choose `main` in the dropdown under Source.

  5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

  You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

  > **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your group to further your knowledge:

  * How can CSS be used to apply a different style to an `<a>` element when a cursor points at it?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 3. Instructor Review: Mini Project (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Semantic HTML

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `alt` attribute

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: inline`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `position: fixed`

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Everyone's landing pages will look different, so don't worry if yours doesn't look exactly like what we are about to review. As long as your landing page fulfills all of the specifications of the project, you did great!

  * We use `<link>` to link the HTML page to the CSS. The `<link>` is placed in the `<head>` and uses an `href` attribute to set the relative path to the CSS style sheet:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/css/style.css/">
    ```

  * üîë We use semantic HTML to define the header and an unordered list to create a list of links:

    ```html
    <header>
      <nav class="text-right">
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></li>
          <li> <a href="#">Portfolio</a></li>
          <li> <a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    ```

  * We use a `<h1>` section heading for the title:

    ```html
    <h1 class="text-center">My New Website</h1>
    ```

  * üîë We use a `<figure>` element to add an image and a caption. We use an `alt` attribute to describe the image:

    ```html
    <figure>
        <img src="./assets/images/image-1.png" alt="Graphic with Coming Soon text">
        <figcaption class="text-center">Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    ```

  * We use semantic HTML to define a section for the contact form. Inside the `<section>`, we add a sub-header. For accessibility, it is important that the section headings are organized in descending order. So because we used `<h1>` previously, we use `<h2>` now:

    ```html
    <section id="contact">
        <h2 class="text-center">Contact Me</h2>
    ```

  * You probably had to research how to create a form. A Google search can help you quickly learn how to use an unfamiliar element in your webpage:

    ```html
    <form>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <label class="text-right" for="name">Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="name" name="user-name">
        </li>
        <li>
          <label class="text-right" for="email">Email:</label>
          <input type="text" id="email" name="user-email">
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text-center">
        <button type="submit">SEND</button>
      </div>
    </form>
    ```

  * Finally, we added a footer with a `class` attribute used for styling:

    ```html
    <footer class="text-center">
      ¬© 2022 My New Website Productions
    </footer>
    ```

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We use a universal selector to set the margin and padding of all elements to 0:

    ```css
    * {
      margin:0;
      padding:0;
    }
    ```

  * üîë We use an element selector to select all the list items and set the display property to `inline`. This will create a horizontal set of links in the navbar:

    ```css
    li {
      display: inline;
      padding: 20px;
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To keep the header fixed to the top of the viewport, we set the position to `fixed`:

    ```css
    header {
      position: fixed;
      border-bottom: 10px solid #DDAF94;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to design webpages with accessibility in mind?

  * üôã Making your website accessible to more people can result in more users!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on structuring the web with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML) and the [MDN Web Docs on learning to style HTML using CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to introduce the Challenge.

### 4. Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * For Module 01's Challenge, you will use your new HTML and CSS skills to ensure that an existing website is accessible using the provided guidelines.

  * Accessibility is an increasingly important consideration in web design. Inclusive design aims to ensure that all users&mdash;including those with disabilities&mdash;can interact with and understand a webpage's content.

  * During this week's activities, we had a brief introduction to the use of semantic HTML and accessibility concerns. This project will require you to do some research to ensure that the goal stated in the user story and each part of the acceptance criteria is fully addressed.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to use HTML and CSS to build a website that is accessible to all users.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã We will use new skills in HTML and CSS to refactor an existing webpage and build off of the accessibility concepts covered in class.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Developers need to be able to design websites with all users in mind so that they can create inclusive user experiences and attract more users to various projects.

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Challenge Requirements found in `02-Challenge/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to flex time.
### 5. FLEX (30 min)

* This time can be utilized for reviewing key topics learned so far in this module or getting started on the Challenge.

### 6. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rT5yNgE7-lTjmLAqPsNJkTTkR_NPQcxZnn9NII1JSuM/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Advanced CSS**: This module is all about deepening our knowledge of CSS in order to build attractive, responsive UIs for our applications.

  * **Why do we use CSS?** CSS allows us to make plain HTML content in our applications look clean and presentable to users.

  * **What are some features of a well-designed app?**

    * Well-designed apps should have a mobile-responsive layout, good use of color contrast and space, readable font sizes, accessible design, and features that enhance the user's experience.

  * **What is our role in implementing these features?**

    * We are not graphic designers, but as web developers, it is our job to build a user interface that is usable and visually appealing to the app's target audience.

    * We need to make sure that our app follows accessibility standards, performs well on both mobile and desktop devices, and is easy to maintain.

  * **Can we build well-designed apps with CSS?**

    * Yes, we can! Browsers are constantly adding support for more CSS-based tools that we can use.

    * Those tools include flexbox and grid for responsive layouts, transitions for animating the user interface, new units of size for developers to use, image color filtering, and more!

  * **How can we learn to build these features?**

  * CSS is a unique language, as it gives the developer many options for how to accomplish a goal. The best way to build CSS knowledge is to build apps and experiment with what does or doesn't work!

  * Try some of the following techniques to learn CSS:

    * Read the official documentation and practice with the provided examples.

    * Reverse-engineer finished code to see how it was created.

    * Build something from scratch.

    * Debug a broken app using Chrome DevTools.

    * And most importantly, ask questions!

  * In this module, we will learn how to build responsive web designs, perform a CSS reset, and implement CSS custom properties and selectors.

  * Let's take a quick look at the mini-project that we will complete at the end of this module.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Solved/index.html` in your browser and open Chrome DevTools to demonstrate simulating a mobile viewport.

  * To access the Chrome DevTools, we can press Cmd+Opt+I on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows.

  * We can enable the device emulator by clicking the "Toggle device toolbar" icon in the top-left.

  * We can select Responsive and drag the edges of the screen to any size we want. Or we can choose from the drop-down list of popular devices.

  * üîë We are viewing the mini-project that we will be able to build by the end of this module.

  * üîë The mini-project is a webpage that holds a collection of CSS snippets that we learned throughout this module. It's like a CSS cheat sheet!

  * üîë Notice what happens to the layout when we change the screen size. The columns shift and stack as the screen gets smaller. This is called **responsive web design**. This is accomplished by using media queries and flexbox, which we will cover today.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are deepening our knowledge of CSS and learning about responsive web design.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build on or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã We are continuing to build on our knowledge of HTML and CSS.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Learning more advanced CSS with attractive layouts creates webpages that stand out. Responsive web design is crucial because users increasingly access webpages from devices with varying screen sizes, resolutions, and orientations. To maintain a good user experience, developers must be able to design webpages that are attractive and accessible from any platform.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 7. BREAK (30 min)

### 8. Instructor Demo: Media Query for Screen (5 min)

* Open `01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We see a dark-blue header, a dark-tan navbar, a green sidebar, and a white body section. We also see white image placeholders.

  * üîë When we open Chrome DevTools and start shrinking the screen size, these components change colors!

  * üîë First, the header will change to a deep-red color when the screen size gets to 992px. Then, the navbar will change to a dark-pink color when the screen size gets to 768px. Finally, the image placeholders will change to a blue color when the screen size gets to 576px or smaller.

  * This is all made possible by using media queries.

* Open `01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * When we use `max-width` as the breakpoint, we need to go from widest to narrowest to avoid any conflicts.

  * We use `@media screen` and then set the breakpoint using `max-width`:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px)
    ```

  * Then we set the styles that will change at that breakpoint. For us, it was changing the header color:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
      header {
        background: #772014;
      }
    }
    ```

  * For the breakpoint of 768px, we changed the navbar color:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      nav {
        background-color: #bb8588;
      }
    }
    ```

  * For the breakpoint of 576px, we changed the image placeholders' colors:

    ```cs
    @media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
      .sample-img {
        background-color: #8ac4ff;
      }
    }
    ```

  * Of course, we can change more than just the background colors when the screen size gets smaller. Do you remember what the layout of the page looked like when we shrank that screen size earlier?

* Go back to the `index.html` in the browser and demonstrate how squished the layout looks.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è If there's a `max-width`, is there also a `min-width`?

  * üôã Yes! Ultimately, you'd want to use `min-width` and design for a "mobile-first" approach, but it's easier to learn media queries taking a "desktop-first" approach and using `max-width` instead. Although we use `max-width` here, you'll likely see `min-width` used in some future activities as well.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build the next activity?

  * üôã We would need to use media queries to change the width of the components so that they stack on top of each other when the screen size gets smaller.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Media-Query-Screen/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Media Query for Screen (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Media-Query-Screen/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement Media Queries for Screens

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As an online shopper, I want to view products clearly on my mobile phone as well as my computer.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the screen size is larger than 992px and the product cards on the screen are side by side.

  * It's done when I change the screen size to 992px or smaller, and the product cards on the screen split into two columns.

  * It's done when I change the screen size to 768px or smaller, and the product cards on the screen become stacked on top of each other.

  * Optional: Just for fun, change the background color of the header each time the product cards change layout.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance at 992px or smaller:

  ![On an online store's webpage, four cards are split into two rows and two columns.](./Images/01-product-columns.png)

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance at 768px or smaller:

  ![On an online store's webpage, two cards are stacked on top of each other.](./Images/02-products-stacked.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * What is the media feature we use to check for the maximum width of the display area?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * What is mobile-first design?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* When breaking everyone into groups, remind students and TAs that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be addressed. It's a good way for your team to encourage and prioritize students who need extra help.

### 10. Instructor Review: Media Query for Screen (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with media queries for screen? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `@media screen`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `width` of cards

* Open `02-Stu_Media-Query-Screen/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We are given an online store webpage with product cards. When the screen size gets smaller, the product cards shift so that they are clearly viewable on a smaller screen.

  * The cards lie side by side in a row. If we look at the following code, for when the screen size is larger than 992px wide, we see that the cards have a width of 25%, because there are four cards:

    ```css
    .card {
      width: 25%;
    }
    ```

  * üîë But as the screen gets smaller, we need to have the cards stacked. So first, we use a media query with a breakpoint of 992px:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px)
    ```

  * üîë Then we give the cards a `width` of 50%, shown in the following example, which will cause half of the cards to stack beneath the other half:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
      .card {
        width: 50%;
      }
    }
    ```

  * For the breakpoint of 768px, we go back to allowing the card width to be 100%:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      .card {
        width: 100%;
      }
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is a more efficient way to control the layout of a webpage?

  * üôã We can use flexbox, which we'll cover in the next activity!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 11. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Layout (5 min)

* Open `03-Ins_Flexbox-Layout/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We see a simple header on top with four cards in the body section. The cards consist of just a header. But we see that the Camera card is larger than the rest.

* Open `03-Ins_Flexbox-Layout/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë To create a flex container, we set the value of the `display` property to `flex`:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      margin-top: 2%;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To force elements to the next line if they don't fit, we set the value of the `flex-wrap` property to `wrap`:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      margin-top: 2%;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To align the items and distribute the empty space between the child elements of the flex container, we use `justify-content`. There are different values we can assign, like `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`, and `space-between` which is what we've used in the following example:

    ```css
    .main-header {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
    }
    ```

  * üîë When we want to control how the items will grow or shrink according to the available space, we can use the `flex` properties: `flex-grow` and `flex-basis`. Usually we just use the `flex` shorthand to set the three values of those properties in that order:

    ```css
    .card {
      /* A flex-basis of 200px sets the starting width */
      /* A flex-grow value of 1 allows the elements to evenly grow to fill the remaining space */
      flex: 1 0 200px;
    }

    .card.camera {
      /* With a flex-grow value of 2, this element grows twice as wide as others */
      /* The second value, flex-shrink, defines how the element will shrink if it can't fit */
      flex: 2 1 200px;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build the next activity?

  * üôã We will need to use flexbox to implement a grid layout and ensure that all of the items are clearly shown on the page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/README.md`.

### 12. Student Do: Flexbox Layout (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üêõ Product Cards Run Off the Page

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a user, I want to view all products in two or more rows.

  * As a user, I don't want to scroll horizontally to see additional products.

  ## Expected Behavior

  Product cards that don't fit within the first row should display on the next row.

  ## Actual Behavior

  Product cards run off the page in a single row.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

  ![On an online store's webpage, products are spread over two stacked rows of three cards each.](./Images/01-product-grid.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * What additional flexbox properties could help direct the behavior of child elements?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. In what other directions could it run?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 13. Instructor Review: Flexbox Layout (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with flexbox layouts? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: flex`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `flex-wrap: wrap`

* Open `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/Unsolved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * Let's open Chrome DevTools and toggle the device toolbar. When we make the screen smaller, notice what happens to the header and the product cards. The text in the header is squished, and the product cards run off the page!

  * So we know that the broken code that we need to debug and fix is the `.main-header` and the product cards in the `main` container.

* Open `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë The `main` container and the `.main-header` already have the `display` property set to `flex`:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
    }

    .main-header {
      display: flex;
    }
    ```

  * üîë We just need to set the `flex-wrap` property to `wrap` so that the elements are forced to wrap over to the next line if they don't fit:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      /* Forces elements to the next line if they don't fit */
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }

    .main-header {
      display: flex;
      /* Forces elements to the next line if they don't fit */
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. Which other directions could it run in?

  * üôã Flexbox can also run from top to bottom in columns!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 14. Instructor Demo: Responsive Design (5 min)

* Open `05-Ins_Responsive-Design/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë The core concept of responsive design is that a webpage should adjust to all devices. In other words, a web app that is created with responsive design in mind will look good and function well no matter what device a user is on.

  * üîë  Not only is responsive design better for the user, but the tools made available to us by CSS can also make development faster. This is because we don't have to write lines and lines of HTML in order to accommodate multiple devices.

  * Let's open Chrome DevTools and shrink the screen size to see what happens to the page elements.

  * üîë When we get to 780px or smaller, we see that the navbar links stack on top of each other.

  * üîë We have also forced the sidebar to stack below the body instead of on top of it.

* Open `05-Ins_Responsive-Design/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We accomplished this by using media queries and flexbox properties!

  * üîë We gave the `flex-direction` property of both `main` and `nav` a value of `column` so that the elements stack on top of each other:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      main,
      nav {
        flex-direction: column;
      }
    ```

  * üîë We forced the sidebar `aside` to stack below the body by assigning the `order` property a value of `2`:

    ```css
    aside {
      order: 2;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build the next activity?

  * üôã We need to figure out which flexbox properties are being used at each breakpoint so that the layout changes at different screen sizes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Responsive-Design/README.md`.

### 15. Student Do: Responsive Design (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Responsive-Design/README.md`.

* This activity won't require any coding, but instead students will need to reverse-engineer code and figure out what is allowing the layout to change at certain breakpoints. Guiding questions have been provided; students will need to write their answers as comments.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìê Add Comments to Implementation of a Responsive Design

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved/assets/css/style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css).

  ---

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

    * What other CSS property can we use to create responsive layouts?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 16. Instructor Review: Responsive Design (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with responsive web design using media queries and flexbox? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: flex`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `flex-wrap`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `justify-content`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `flex` shorthand

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `flex-direction`

* Open `06-Stu_Responsive-Design/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * This activity didn't require any coding on our part. Instead we were given a fully functioning webpage, and we had to explain how it works! Through this kind of activity, we can improve our computational thinking skills.

* Go through each question (üîë) in the `style.css` and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * üîë What happens when we set the `display` property to `flex`, as shown in the following example?

      ```css
    nav {
      display: flex;
    }
    ```

  * üôã The `flex` container becomes flexible! The child items of the container all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.

  * üîë What is the `flex-wrap` property?

  * üôã It specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not. The value can be set to `nowrap`, `wrap-reverse`, or `wrap`, like in the following example:

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    ```

  * üîë What does the `justify-content` property do?

  * üôã It aligns the flex items and distributes the empty space between them. In this activity, we are telling the product cards to be centered:

    ```css
    .products {
      flex: 4;
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      justify-content: center;
    }
    ```

  * üîë What is the `flex` property a shorthand property for?

  * üôã It is a shorthand property for the `flex-grow` and `flex-basis` properties&mdash;in that order. In this activity, we are making the product cards not growable and not shrinkable, with an initial length of 400px:

    ```css
    .card {
      flex: 0 0 400px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë What does the `flex-direction` property define?

  * üôã It defines in which direction the container wants to stack its flex items. In this activity, we are telling the main body element and the navbar to stack vertically in a column:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      main,
      nav {
        flex-direction: column;
      }
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What other CSS property can we use to create responsive layouts?

  * üôã We can use the CSS grid layout.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on the CSS Flexible Box Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 17. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Placement (5 min)

* Open `07-Ins_Flexbox-Placement/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we change the screen size, the two product cards remain centered at all times.

* Open `07-Ins_Flexbox-Placement/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We have already set the `display` to `flex` and the `flex-direction` to `row`:

    ```css
    .products {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Since we set the `flex-direction` to `row`, that becomes our main axis. We use `justify-content: center` to center the items along the main axis, like in the following example:

    ```css
    .products {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
      /* Centers along the main axis determined by flex-direction */
      justify-content: center;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Then we can use `align-items` to center them along the opposite axis (vertically):

    ```css
    .products {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
      /* Centers along the main axis determined by flex-direction */
      justify-content: center;
      /* Centers along the opposite axis */
      align-items: center;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Finally, we set the height according to the height of the viewport:

    ```css
    .products {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row;
      /* Centers along the main axis determined by flex-direction */
      justify-content: center;
      /* Centers along the opposite axis */
      align-items: center;
      /* Uses the height of the viewport */
      height: 100vh;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build the next activity?

  * üôã We will need to use `justify-content` and `align-items` accordingly, to align the child elements correctly.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement/README.md`.

### 18. Student Do: Flexbox Placement (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üêõ Link and Button Placement is Incorrect

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a user, I want the navigation links to be on the right side.

  * As a user, I want the slideshow buttons to be sized as smaller icons and centered alongside the image.

  ## Expected Behavior

  The navigation links are aligned to the right. The slideshow buttons are smaller than the image and are centered alongside the image.

  ## Actual Behavior

  The navigation links are aligned to the left. The slideshow buttons extend to the same height as the image.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

  ![The navigation links are aligned to the right, and the slideshow buttons are center aligned.](./Images/01-product-page.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * What are some of the other possible values for flexbox's alignment and justification properties?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * What e-commerce websites can you find that are using flexbox properties to help organize their components and layouts?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 19. Instructor Review: Flexbox Placement (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with flexbox justification and alignment? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `justify-content: flex-end`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `align-items: center`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `align-items: flex-start`

* Open `08-Stu-Flexbox-Placement/Unsolved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see that the navbar links are on the left, but we need them on the right side.

  * We also see the long slideshow buttons on both sides of the image. We need to make them smaller and centered.

* Open `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë First we need to align the navbar links to the far right, or on the end of the navbar. We do that by giving the `justify-content` property a value of `flex-end`:

    ```css
    nav {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: flex-end;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Next we need to fix the slideshow buttons. The buttons are child items of `.product-slideshow` so we set that to `align-items: center` to have the buttons centered alongside the image:

    ```css
    .product-slideshow {
      display: flex;
      /* Align the child elements to the center of the parent */
      align-items: center;
    }
    ```

  * üîë Once we do that and compare to the screenshot, we notice that the image is also centered. But we want it to be aligned to the top, so we set the `align-items` property of `.product` to `flex-start` to match the image:

    ```css
    .product {
      display: flex;
      align-items: flex-start;
      width: 90%;
      margin: 1% auto;
    }
    ```

  * Lastly, this isn't something we had to do, but in the media query, notice how the buttons are removed when the screen size gets too small:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      .product-slideshow button {
        /* Removes the slideshow buttons from the document flow */
        display: none;
      }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What was the main axis of this page?

  * üôã The main axis ran top to bottom, which was defined by `flex-direction: column`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on flexbox alignment and justification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#Alignment_justification_and_distribution_of_free_space_between_items), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
