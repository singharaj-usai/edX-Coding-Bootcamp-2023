### Pre-Class Drill

* 20 min before class starts write the following problem on the board or Slack it out:

* Run the following code and explain the output:

```js
var sample = function(){
  var a = b = 3;
}
sample();
console.log("Is a defined?", typeof a !== "undefined");
console.log("Is b defined?", typeof b !== "undefined");

```

* Tell students that this is a bit different from the problems we've seen so far. Explain that:

  * There are a few different types of interview problems that they'll see as developers.

  * Some focus on logic, like the ones we've seen so far, and some focus on measuring understanding of the language.

  * JavaScript has a lot of quirks that make it unique from other languages. Understanding those quirks will make them stronger JavaScript developers.

* After 15 minutes explain the following points:

  * `var a = b = 3` is equivalent to writing:

  ```js
  b = 3;
  var a = b;
  ```

  * This means that `b` is created globally (unless you use strict mode) because there is no `var` keyword in the variable definition.

  * After `b` is created globally, `b` is assigned the value 3. Then `a` is created locally inside the function and assigned the value of `b`, which is 3.

  * Because `a` is created locally, it doesnâ€™t exist outside the function.

* Take a couple of student questions, if time permits, before moving on.
