# 08.1 Full-Time Lesson Plan: Project 2

## Overview

Today's class will be focused on introducing students to project 2 requirements.

## Instructor Notes

* Today's class will be focused on introducing students to the requirements for project 2.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

* Students will begin work on their second project.

* Leverage the TAs to help any groups lagging behind during the lesson. We want to give students as much time to brainstorm project ideas as possible.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Submit a project proposal (ideas, outlines, APIs) for feedback.

* Create a project repo that is set up with linting and group members as collaborators.

* Make progress towards building the MVP of their project

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Introduce Project (15 min)

* Welcome students to class. Praise students for making it to their second group projects.

* Assure the class that they'll have plenty of time to brainstorm project ideas before submitting their proposals for review by the end of class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yIYYYI9UAmr8LE8owcGIGKo6Rdx6t1MsXoqp4vgwZ3s/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Project Requirements**: Discuss the project requirements outlined in the slide deck.

  * **Presentation Requirements**: Discuss the presentation requirements outlined in the slide deck.

  * **Project Metrics**: Your project will be evaluated on its concept, design, functionality, collaboration, and presentation, as well as the quality of your repository and whether or not your application is deployed.

  * **Group Members**: Announce the project group members that you have prepared prior to class. You can add a slide to this module's slide deck to list the group members, or you can send the list out to students via Slack. Let students know that they will be allowed to create their own groups for the final project.

* Direct the students to the [requirements for Project 2](../../../../01-Class-Content/15-Project-2/02-Challenge/README.md).

* Let students know that they can use their code from the previous module to set up authentication for their project.

* Answer any questions about project requirements.

### 2. Student Do: Set Up Repository (15 mins)

* Navigate to GitHub in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * ðŸ”‘ After you get into your project groups, you will create a new project repo, protect the `main` branch, and invite each other as collaborators.

  * ðŸ”‘ One group member should create a new Github repo for the project.

  * ðŸ”‘ Next, protect the repo's `main` branch by doing the following:

    * On the repo's page, click the "Settings" tab.

    * Select "Branches" from the left sidebar.

    * Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule".

    * Type `main` in the "Branch name pattern" input, then check off the following options:

      * "Require pull request reviews before merging"

      * "Include administrators"

    * Click "Create"

  * ðŸ”‘ Once the branch is protected, invite the other group members as collaborators.

* Answer any questions before breaking up your students into their project groups.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 3. Student Do: Project Brainstorming (90 mins)

* Direct students to begin to brainstorming with their group members to identify project ideas, project designs, and research which new library, package, or technology they can use that hasn't been discussed yet.

* At your discretion, feel free to utilize TAs and host "workshops" to help steer groups in the right direction.

* Use the talking points below to guide and encourage the students:

  * Many of you may only have a rough idea of what your project will consist of. This is a good opportunity to rule out ideas and get a good sense of what is feasible.

  * Be cautious of underestimating the amount of time that features will take to implement. Try thinking of the MVP for each idea and attempt to pick the idea that excites your group and seems feasible in the time you have.

### 4. BREAK (30 mins)

### 5. Student Do: Project Work

* Direct the students to begin working in their project groups to finalize project ideas and start working on the MVP.

* Be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Students should expect to submit initial project idea proposals by the end of class today.
