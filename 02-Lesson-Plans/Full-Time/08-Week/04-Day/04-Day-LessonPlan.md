# 08.4 Full-Time Lesson Plan: Project 2

## Overview

In today's class, students will have time both to outline their presentations, and to complete work on their projects.

## Instructor Notes

* No classroom instruction today.

* This is the last day of class that students have to work on their projects. 

* Once again, your students' success post-bootcamp depends on the quality of their projects. Their presentations compose much of this quality and students need to think about how to communicate the development process of their apps if they hope to impress interviewers with their experience.

* Make sure students spend about an hour outlining their presentations.

* Prioritize working with groups that may be at risk of failure or unable to deploy a functional application. 

* Remind students to use the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to prepare for their presentations in the next session. Inform students that they will have 10 minutes to present and must be prepared to answer questions.

* You will assume the role of "scrummaster" and hold daily scrum meetings with each group. The purpose of these scrums is to: 

	1. Gauge progress on projects

	2. Course correct if scope creeps or focus shifts

	3. Most importantly, hold students accountable. Participation is a requirement for receipt of a passing grade. 

* Keep the daily scrums short. Ask each student the following questions:

	* What did you accomplish? 

	* What are your goals? 

	* Are there any obstacles? 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Make progress towards finalizing the MVP of their project.

* Outline their project presentation.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.
 
* Inform them that today is the last class time to work on their projects in their groups. They will start outlining their project presentations in preparation for the next class.

* Answer any questions before proceeding.

### 2. Student Do: Outline Presentations (55 mins)

* Announce that students will start to outline their presentations.

* Make sure they don't code. They should consider:

  * The structure of their presentation

  * The key messages they need to show 
  
  * The details that they should _avoid_ reviewing (they only have 10 minutes to talk)

* Let students know that the presentation of any project to an audience must flow like a story. Their narrative should open on a conflict, hint at a potential resolution for that problem, depict the steps taken to resolve the issue, and finally end on the resolution of the conflict with an eye toward the future. In other words:

  * What problem does their app focus on?

  * How does their app solve this problem at a high-level?

  * What steps did they take to build the app?

* Let students know that it's important to show their app running and solving the problem that began this story.

* While the groups organize their presentations, offer to answer any questions about presentation day.

* Make sure that students aren't coding during this time. If it looks like they are, just gently ask how they're progressing so far with their presentation outline.
  
### 3. Student Do: Project Work

* Direct students to continue to work with their groups on their projects while instructional staff make themselves available for assistance.

* Hold daily scrums with each group. Ask each student in the group the following questions:

	* What did you accomplish? 

	* What are your goals? 

	* Are there any obstacles? 

### 4. BREAK (30 mins)

### 5. Student Do: Project Work

* Direct students to continue to work with their groups on their projects while instructional staff make themselves available for assistance.

* Visit each group and answer any questions they may have about coding their app or presenting in the next class.

* Some students may feel nervous with their deadline approaching. Reassure them that they have solid project ideas and that they'll be fine as long as they prepare for their presentation.

* A few groups might not seem poised to finish their apps time. Tell them to drop any undeveloped and unnecessary features. Even if they can't meet their proposed goal, they should still present a functional app in the next class. Add in that they can talk about the dropped features as planned updates.

* Answer any questions before ending class.
