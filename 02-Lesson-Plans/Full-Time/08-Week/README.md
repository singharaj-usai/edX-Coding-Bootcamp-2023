# Module 15 & 16 Instructor Overview: Project 2

## Overview

In Module 15, students will begin work on their second project of the Boot Camp--a full-stack application which connects a robust back-end with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication to an intuitive front end.

In Module 16, students will continue to work on their second project and present their projects to the class at the end of the module. They'll also begin to revise their professional materials, including their portfolios, and add their projects once they've completed them.

Review the Roadmap for each module in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and the group project for these modules.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Prepare a list of project group members prior to the first class of Module 15. This time, assign three students per group, all around the same skill level. You can add a slide to this module's slide deck to list the group members, or you can send the list out to students via Slack. Let students know that they will be allowed to create their own groups for the final project.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

* Encourage students to spend time pseudocoding their projects and researching APIs and libraries before writing any code. Remind them that they already have code they can reuse for authentication from the previous module.

* Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before presentation day.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

In Module 17, you'll be taking a look at how computer science relates to what students have learned so far with JavaScript. We recommend that you take a moment to review topics that pertain to data structures, the JavaScript event loop, and closures. Keep in mind that these topics can be hard for students to grasp, but it's important to learn because it will help students prepare for the technical interview phase of any software job.

In Module 18, we will return to the back end and learn about NoSQL databases. We will learn about the features of a non-relational database and how it compares to a relational database. Finally, we will explore why we might use NoSQL for an application.

Be sure to have MongoDB and Compass installed on your machine before class. Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB and Compass on your machine.

Also, make sure students have MongoDB and Compass installed prior to coming to class.
