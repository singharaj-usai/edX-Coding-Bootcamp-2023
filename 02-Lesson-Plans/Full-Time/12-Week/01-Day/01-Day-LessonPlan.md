# 12.1 Full-Time Lesson Plan: Project 3

## Overview

Today's class will be focused on introducing students to project 3 requirements.

## Instructor Notes

* Today's class will be focused on introducing students to the requirements for project 3.

* Students will also begin work on their final projects. These projects are student-driven; they will be responsible for forming their own teams, brainstorming app ideas, and developing a full-stack MERN app.

* Encourage students to start forming groups and brainstorming ideas for their apps, and be prepared to help anyone who is struggling to find a group or project idea.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

* Leverage the TAs to help any groups lagging behind during the lesson. We want to give students as much time to brainstorm project ideas as possible.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create groups for the final project.

* Submit a project proposal (ideas, outlines, APIs) for feedback.

* Create a project repo that is set up with linting and group members as collaborators.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Introduce Project (15 min)

* Welcome students to class. Praise students for making it to their final group projects.

* Assure the class that they'll have plenty of time to brainstorm project ideas before submitting their proposals for review by the end of class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LEi2YB8KGHHD4naTSMMWv4QUrDl34tTkdDoX9AcK3UE/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Project Requirements**: Discuss the project requirements outlined in the slide deck.

  * **Presentation Requirements**: Discuss the presentation requirements outlined in the slide deck.

  * **Project Metrics**: Your project will be evaluated on its concept, design, functionality, collaboration, and presentation, as well as the quality of your repository and whether or not your application is deployed.

  * **Group Members**: Advise students that for the final project they will be choosing their own group members. Ask students to provide their proposed group to the instructor for approval via Slack.

* Direct the students to the [requirements for Project 3](../../../../01-Class-Content/23-Project-3/02-Challenge/README.md).

* Answer any questions about project requirements.

### 2. Students Do: Deploy a Project or Challenge and Include in Portfolio (15 min)

* Students are nearing the end of the course and will soon start applying and interviewing for developer positions. It is important that students have quality work to demonstrate their skills to potential employers.

* Students should deploy at least one project or Challenge assignment that they've completed and link to it from their portfolio page.

### 3. Student Do: Project Brainstorming (90 mins)

* Direct students to begin brainstorming with their group members to identify project ideas, project designs, and research which new library, package, or technology they can use that hasn't been discussed yet.

* At your discretion, feel free to utilize TAs and host "workshops" to help steer groups in the right direction.

* Use the talking points below to guide and encourage the students:

  * Many of you may only have a rough idea of what your project will consist of. This is a good opportunity to rule out ideas and get a good sense of what is feasible.

  * Be cautious of underestimating the amount of time that features will take to implement. Try thinking of the MVP for each idea and attempt to pick the idea that excites your group and seems feasible in the time you have.

### 4. BREAK (30 mins)

### 5. Student Do: Project Work

* Direct the students to begin working in their project groups to finalize project ideas and start working on the MVP.

* Let students know that they can also use this time to work on their portfolios.

* Be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Students should expect to submit initial project idea proposals by the end of class today.

### 6. END (0 min)
