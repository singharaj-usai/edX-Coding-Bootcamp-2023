# Full Stack Full-Time Lesson Plans

## Challenge

For full-time students, each Challenge is assigned and due on Mondays and Thursdays. The Challenge that is assigned on Monday is due on Thursday and the Challenge assigned on Thursday is due on Monday.

**Note**: The following are default days of the week that Challenges are assigned/due in BCS and are subject to change with holidays.

### Monday & Thursday - After Class

**Note**: Students receive Challenge instructions and starter code in Canvas, but you may want to add them to the class repo as well. Students do not receive solution code in Canvas.

* Copy the new Challenge instructions and, if applicable, the starter code inside the `Develop` folder into the class repo.

* Copy the Challenge solution code inside the `Main` folder for the prior Challenge assignment into the class repo.

## Career Connection

Each week, students receive Career Connections in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas that tie what we do in the classroom to the profession, along with technical interviewing practice.
