# Module 02 Instructor Overview: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In this module, students will implement media queries and flexbox to create a responsive web design. Students will also overwrite browser defaults by using a CSS reset and then rebuild those styles using advanced CSS concepts, such as pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's Challenge.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo before every class and to have that day's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* Be ready to use Chrome DevTools and the device emulator to quickly demonstrate various CSS concepts on different screen sizes.

* Make sure to remind students that CSS is a broad language with many tricks to learn. They shouldn't expect to learn it all in one week. In fact, they will continue to build their CSS knowledge throughout the entire course.

* When learning about typography, students will probably see different fonts on their machines depending on the operating system they're using. Therefore, be prepared to discuss web-safe fonts and font fallbacks.

* Remind students to complete this module's assessment near the end of the week. Students can find it in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

* Next week, you will introduce students to JavaScript. This may be a big leap for some students. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions and be available during office hours. 

* Starting with the next module, students will be solving algorithms that they are likely to see in technical interviews. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the weekly algorithm problems, so you can help students with any questions they might have&mdash;they're sure to have some!
