# 03.2 Weekday Lesson Plan: Arrays and Functions

## Overview

This class is a continuation of JavaScript fundamentals. The activities today focus on arrays, iteration, and array methods. Function expressions, function declarations, and scope are also introduced.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `11-Ins_Arrays` through `20-Stu_Methods`.

* Take a few minutes before class to review the activities of the day and think about questions that students who are new to JavaScript might ask. 

* In `18-Stu_Scope`, students will work with a partner to debug some broken code and learn more about scope and shadowing. This is a challenging activity, especially for learners new to programming languages. Review the solution code before class and try to anticipate questions that might arise. If need be, review the [MDN Web Docs on scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) so that you can confidently answer students' questions. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to: 

* Create an array and access elements using the index.

* Iterate over an array using a `for` loop.

* Write a function expression and a function declaration.

* Identify the difference between global and local scope.

* Implement array methods.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Display the number 4,294,967,295. Do not provide further context at this point&mdash;the goal is to pique students' curiosity. 

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think the number 4,294,967,295 represents in JavaScript? 

  * 🙋 4,294,967,295 is the maximum number of values that can be stored in a single variable in JavaScript. 

* Explain that so far, we have been using variables to store a single value&mdash;like `"Hello, World"`, `5`, or `true`&mdash;and writing blocks of code that execute once. But that is not very efficient, especially when working with big data. 

* Stress that during today's class, we will think bigger! JavaScript can handle billions of values. So, building on the JavaScript skills we've acquired so far, we will learn how to store multiple values in a single array, perform an action on all the values stored in a variable with just a few lines of code, and even write code blocks that we can reuse again and again. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Arrays (5 min) 

* Open `11-Ins_Array/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Previously, we learned how to use `var` and the assignment operator `=` to store a single value in a variable, as follows:

    ```js
    var name = "Andre";
    var pets = 3; 
    var isStudent = true;
    ```

  * 🔑 We also use `var` and `=` to store multiple values in a variable. To do this, we put the values in brackets `[]`, separated by commas, like in the following example: 

    ```js
    var names = ["Andre", "Karl", "Rashida", "Olivia"];
    ```

  * 🔑 To access the entire array, we use the array's name, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(names);
    ```

  * 🔑 To access a single element in an array, we use the array's name plus the item's **index** (or place in the array) in brackets `[]`. Arrays are **zero-indexed**. So the first element in an array has an index of `0`, not `1`. Thus, the element with the index of `1` in the following example is `"Karl"`:

    ```js
    console.log(names[1]);
    ```

  * 🔑 And using `0` in the following example will log `Andre`:

    ```js
    console.log(names[0]); 
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also use an element's index to replace a value in the array.

  * 🔑 In the `names` array, in the following example, the string `"Olivia"` has an index of `3`:

    ```js
    console.log(names[3]);
    ```

  * 🔑 We reassign `names[3]` to a new string `"Carter"` using the assignment operator `=`. In the following example, after reassignment, the new value `"Carter"` is logged: 

    ```js
    names[3] = "Carter"; 

    console.log(names[3])
    ```

  * 🔑 Arrays also have properties. We find the total number of elements in the array using the `length` property. Because the `names` array has four elements, the following statement will return `4`:

    ```js
    console.log(names.length)
    ```

* Open `11-Ins_Array/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * When we log an array to the console using its name, the entire array is returned.

  * When we click on the arrow to the left of the data, the indexes of each element in the array are shown. This is a handy way to inspect an array and find the index of an element that we want to work with.

  * When we log an array's length, a number is returned. That number equals the total number of elements in the array.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we store multiple values in a variable?

  * 🙋 We would use an array. 

  * ☝️ How can we access an element in the array? 

  * 🙋 We use the array name and the index. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Student Do: Arrays (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Arrays/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗 Log Welcome Messages to Console Using an Array

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As an instructor, I want to create a list of student names and be able to add and rename names.

  ## Acceptance Criteria 

  * It's done when the total number of elements in the array is logged to the console.  

  * It's done when the message "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME" is logged using each element in the array. 

  * It's done when the first element in the array is replaced with the name of a new student.

  * It's done when, after an `if` statement confirms that the first element in the array has been replaced, the message "REPLACED_NAME is in class" is logged.

  ## 💡 Hints

  What is the first index in an array: `0` or `1`? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How could you use the array's `length` property to access the last element in an array of any length?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Arrays (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with arrays? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `var students = ["name1"]`

  * ✔️ `students.length`

  * ✔️ `students[0]`

  * ✔️ `students[0] = "newName"`

* Open `12-Stu_Arrays/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 When we create an array, the elements are placed in brackets `[]`. Each element is separated by a comma, as follows:

    ```js
    var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the array name `students`, followed by `length`, to return a count of the total number of elements in the array. See the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(students.length);
    ```

  * 🔑 We access an element in the array using the element's index. The first element's index is `0`&mdash;as in the following example&mdash;the second element's index is `1`, and so on. 

    ```js
    console.log("Welcome to the class " + students[0]);
    ```

  * 🔑 We replace an element in the array by using the element's index and the assignment operator `=` followed by the new value. The following code replaces the first element in the `student` array with the string `"Bob"`:

    ```js
    students[0] = "Bob";
    ```

  * We check that the first value has been replaced using an `if` statement that evaluates whether `students[0]` equals `"Bob"`. If the condition evaluates to `true`, then in the following example, `"Bob is in class!"` logs to the console: 

    ```js
    if (students[0] === "Bob") {
      console.log(students[0] + " is in class!");
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does it mean that arrays are zero-indexed? 

  * 🙋 The first element of the array has an index of `0`, not `1`.

  * ☝️ What property can we use to determine the total number of elements in an array? 

  * 🙋 The array's `length` property.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Iteration (5 min) 

* Open `13-Ins_Iteration/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use `for` loops to execute a block of code more than once. The complete `for` loop expression dictates how many times the code will be executed, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    
    }
    * The first expression declares a variable. We will use this variable as the counter for the loop. We give `i` the value of `0`.

    ```js
    var i = 0;
    ```

  * The second expression is a condition that determines whether the loop will execute. If the following expression evaluates to `true`, we execute the code, and if it's false, the loop is complete:

    ```js
    i < 5;
    ```

  * After the loop executes the code block, we increment the counter, as follows:

    ```js
    i++
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, in curly brackets, we place the block of code that we want to execute each time the loop runs, as follows:

    ```js
    {
      console.log("This is the current value of i: " + i + ".");
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 When iterating over an array, we use the array's `length` property to determine when the loop should stop. In the following example, as long as `i` is less than the length of `zooAnimals`, the loop will execute the code:
  
    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < zooAnimals.length; i++) 
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also use `i` to access the elements of the array. We can do this using something called **bracket notation**. By placing the counter inside square brackets `[]`, as follows, we can access the elements:

    ```js
    {
      console.log("I am going to zoo to see " + zooAnimals[i] + ".");
    }
    ```

* Open `13-Ins_Iteration/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * In the first loop, the counter variable `i` is initially assigned the value `0`. So the first log shows that the value of `i` is `0`. Then, after the code is executed, `i` is incremented. Thus, when it runs again, `i` is `1`, and so on until the condition `i < 5` is no longer `true`. 

  * In the next loop, instead of just console logging `i`, the variable `i` is used to determine the index of the element. So the first time it is run, `zooAnimals[i]` is read as `zooAnimals[0]`, and `"Bears"` is logged. When the loop runs again, `i` is equal to `1`, so `"Giraffes"` is logged. In this way, we can use a `for` loop to quickly iterate over an entire array&mdash;even a huge one&mdash;with just a few lines of code. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would we want to use a loop in the code? 

  * 🙋 We can execute a block of code over and over again. 

  * ☝️ How do we stop a loop from executing? 

  * 🙋 A loop will stop executing when the condition is `false`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Student Do: Iteration (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Iteration/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Iterate Over an Array to Log Messages to Console

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a member of the class, I want to store a list of my classmates and use that list to create a greeting for each student on the list. 

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the names of five classmates are stored in a single variable named `students`.

  * It's done when the total number of elements in the `students` array is logged to the console. 

  * It's done when, using a `for` loop, the greeting "Great to see you, CLASSMATE_NAME!" logs to the console for each classmate's name in the `students` array. 

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can you access each element using the element's index and the array name? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What’s a `while` loop?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Iteration (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel creating a `for` loop and iterating over an array? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `for` statement 

  * ✔️ Array iteration

* Open `14-Stu_Iteration/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We start by creating a `students` array that holds five names, as follows:

    ```js
    var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
    ```

  * We then use the `length` property to find the total number of elements in the `students` array. This `length` property will come in handy when we set the condition for the loop. See the following code for an example: 

    ```js
    var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
    ```

  * 🔑 We write the `for` loop. We set the counter to `0` and dictate that the loop will run till the counter equals the length of the array, as shown in the following example:
  
    ```js
    for(var i=0; i < students.length; i++)
    ```
  
  * We set the counter `i` to `0`, as follows:

    ```js
    var i = 0;
    ```

  * 🔑 We set the conditions under which the loop will run. Because we want to loop over the entire array, we set the condition such that the loop will stop when the counter equals the length of the array, as follows:

    ```js
    i < students.length;
    ```

  * Finally, after the block of code is executed, we increment the counter by `1`, as shown in the following example:

      ```js
      i++
      ```

  * 🔑 Finally, we console log each statement in the array using bracket notation, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log("Great to see you, " + students[i]);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would iterating over an array be useful?

  * 🙋 By iterating over an array, you can perform an action on each element of the array quickly and with just a few lines of code. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on for statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Functions (5 min)

* Open `15-Ins_Functions/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 We create reusable blocks of code using functions.

  * 🔑 One way we can define a function is to use a **function declaration**. A function declaration starts with the keyword `function` preceding a name and parentheses `()`, like in the following code snippet:

    ```js
    function declareHello()
    ```

  * 🔑 The block of code we want to execute goes in curly brackets `{}`. Then, after the code we want to execute, we use `return`. The return statement stops the execution of the function, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    function declareHello() { 
    console.log("Hello, I am a function declaration.");
    console.log("-----------------------------------");
    return;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also use `var` to declare a function expression. After the assignment operator `=`, we use `function` followed by parentheses `()`. Just like before, in the following example, the code block goes inside curly brackets `{}` and `return` is used:

    ```js
    var expressHello = function() { 
    console.log("Hello, I am a function expression.");
    console.log("-----------------------------------");
    return;
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 When we define a function expression or function declaration, we are simply giving a block of code a name. To execute the function, we call it using the function's name and parentheses `()`, as follows:

    ```js
    declareHello();
    expressHello();
    ```

  * 🔑 Functions can also take parameters! Parameters allow us to pass values into a function by giving the values a name. In the following example, the values we want to use in the code block are given the names `x`, `y`, and `z`:

    ```js
    function declareHelloAgain(x,y,z) { 
    console.log("Hello, my parameter's values are " + x + ", " + y + ", and " + z);
    console.log("-----------------------------------");
    return;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Adding parameters inside the `()` only gives them names, not values! The values are assigned when the function is called. So in the following example, `x` has been assigned `7`, `y` has been assigned `"Hello"`, and `z` has been assigned `true`:

    ```js
    declareHelloAgain(7, "Hello", true);
    ```

* Open `15-Ins_Functions/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following: 

  * Calling a function executes the code block one time. To execute the block of code again, simply call the function again. This makes the code block easily reusable. 

  * When we call `declareHelloAgain`, the values provided for `x`, `y`, and `z`can be accessed by the function. So the message `"Hello, my parameter's values are 7, Hello, and true"` is logged. 

* Let students know that the code we just covered is found in the `sample.js` file and encourage them to look at it for guidance while completing the activity. 
  
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are two ways that we can create a reusable block of code? 

  * 🙋 We can create a function declaration or a function expression.

  * ☝️ How do we execute a function? 

  * 🙋 Declaring a function only gives a block of code a name. To execute it, we have to call it every time we want the action performed. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Student Do: Functions (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Functions/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to know when two values are equal to one another.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I provide two values in function arguments and the function evaluates the values' equality. 

  * It's done if, when the values are strictly equal, the message "They are equal in type and value" is logged. 

  * It's done if, when the two values are equal but not strictly equal, the message "They are equal in value" is logged.

  * It's done if, when the values are not equal or strictly equal, the message "The values are not equal" is logged.

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can we use parameters to give a name to the two values that we want to evaluate with the function? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is hoisting?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Functions (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with functions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `function myFunc(){}`

  * ✔️ Parameters

  * ✔️ `return`

  * ✔️ `myFunc()`

  * ✔️ Function expressions

* Open `16-Stu_Functions/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 To create a function declaration, we start with the keyword `function` and give it a name, `isEqual`. Then, inside the parentheses`()`, we provide two parameters, `x` and `y`, to provide a name for the two values we want the function to evaluate. See the following example:

    ```js
    function isEqual(x,y)
    ```

  * We use an `if` statement to evaluate whether the values are strictly equal. If so, the message `"They are equal in type and value"` will log, as shown in the following statement:

    ```js
    if (x === y) {
      console.log("They are equal in type and value");
    }
    ```

  * If the two values are not strictly equal, we check whether they are equal in value only with `==`. So we add an `else if` statement that will log `"They are equal in value"` if `x == y` evaluates to `true`, as shown in the following example: 

    ```js
    } else if (x == y) {
      console.log("They are equal in value");
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use an `else` statement to log a message if the two values are not strictly equal or equal. We also add a `return` to stop the execution of the function, as follows:

    ```js
    } else {
      console.log("They are not equal");
    }
      return;
    ```

  * 🔑 We execute the block of code by calling it with its name. Inside the parentheses, we put the two values we want to assign to `x` and `y` when the function runs, as follows:

    ```js
    isEqual(10, 10);
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also use a function expression to execute the same block of code. A function expression starts with `var`. Both functions in the following example will do the same thing:

    ```js
    var isEqualTakeTwo = function (x,y) {
        if (x === y) {
          console.log("They are equal in type and value");
        } else if (x == y) {
          console.log("They are equal in value");
        } else {
          console.log("They are not equal");
        }
        return;
    };
    ```

* Open `16-Stu_Functions/Solved/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * When a function is called, the values assigned inside the parentheses `()` are used to execute the code. 

  * So when we assign the values `10` and `10`, the message `"They are equal in type and value"` logs to the console.

  * When we assign the values `10` and `true`, the message `"They are not equal"` logs. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can using functions improve code? 

  * 🙋 Functions are reusable blocks of code that we can execute again and again. Using functions makes code cleaner and more modular. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Scope (5 min)

* Open `17-Ins_Scope/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We have been declaring variables outside of the functions. Variables declared outside of a function, like in the following example, are **globally scoped**:

    ```js
    var hello = "Hello";
    ```

  * A variable in the global scope can be used throughout your code in any function or script. Both of the following functions have access to the value stored in the variable `hello`:

    ```js
    function sayHello() {
      console.log(hello);
      return;
    }

    var sayHelloAgain = function () {
      console.log(hello);
      return;
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 Declaring a variable inside a function changes the scope of the variable. The variable can only be accessed inside that function. This is called **local scope**. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    function sayGoodbye() {
      var goodbye = "Goodbye";
      console.log(goodbye);
      return;
    }
    ```

  * If we try to use a locally scoped variable in another function, like in the following example, we will get an error:

    ```js
    var sayGoodbyeAgain = function () {
      console.log(goodbye);
      return;
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 **Shadowing** happens when we use the same variable name in both the local and global scope, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var shadow = "Hello";
    console.log(shadow);

    function sayWhat() {
      console.log(shadow);
      return;
    }

    var sayWhatAgain = function () {
      var shadow = "Goodbye";
      console.log(shadow);
    };
    ```

  * We should avoid shadowing by giving the local and global variables unique names. Keeping the scope clean and organized makes it easier to develop and work in the codebase.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does it mean when a variable is globally scoped?

  * 🙋 A global variable is accessible to any function or script in the code.

  * ☝️ What does it mean if a variable is locally scoped?

  * 🙋 A local variable is only available inside its own function. It is not available to other functions or scripts. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 13. Student Do: Scope (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_Scope/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  # 🐛 Messages Not Logging to Console Due to Undefined Variables

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

  * As a developer, I want to log messages to the console using variables declared in both global and local scope. 

  ## Expected Behavior

  When the console is opened, a series of messages should log to the console. 

  ## Actual Behavior

  When the console is opened, an error message indicates that at least one variable is undefined, and messages do not log.

  ## 💡 Hints

  Think about how the variable is being used. Is it being made available to all functions, or is it only being used by one function? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is lexical scope?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 14. Instructor Review: Scope (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with scope? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Global scope

  * ✔️ Local scope

  * ✔️ Shadowing

* Open `18-Stu_Scope/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We declare the variable `shout` in the global scope so that it is available to all functions, including `justShout` and `shoutItAllOut`, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var shout = "Shout";

    function justShout() {
      console.log(shout + ", " + shout);
      return;
    }

    function shoutItAllOut() {
      console.log(shout + " it all out! ");
      return;
    }  
    ```

  * 🔑 In the following example, the variable `animals` has been declared locally inside the `sayLions` function, so it is only available in that function:

    ```js
    function sayLions() {
      var animal = "Lions";
      console.log(animal);
      return;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We declare the variable `animals` locally inside the `sayTigers` function. Since a locally scoped variable is only accessed in the function where it is declared, it doesn't change the value of the `animal` variable declared in `sayLions`. In the following example, the `sayLions` function will use the value `Lions`, and the `sayTigers` function will use the value `Tigers`:

    ```js
    function sayTigers() {
      var animal = "Tigers";
      console.log("and " + animal + " and "); 
      return;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 To avoid shadowing, or declaring a variable with the same name in the global and local scope, we remove the `bears` variable in the local scope so that the `sayBears` function will log `"Bears! OH MY!"`, as follows:

    ```js
    var bears = "Bears";

    function sayBears() {
      console.log(bears + "! OH MY!");
      return;
    }

    ```

  * We declare the variable `sing` inside the outer function so that the value of `sing` is available to everything inside the outer function, including the inner function. Shown in the following example, this is called a **nested function**:

    ```js
    function singAlong() {
      var sing = "Sing";
      console.log(sing + ",");
      var singASong = function () {  
        console.log(sing + " a Song.");
      };
      singASong();
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why is it important to know if the variables are defined in the local or global scope? 

  * 🙋 Scope tells us where the variables are accessible to use in our code. If we define the variables in the wrong scope, we will get errors!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Methods (5 min) 

* Open `19-Ins_Methods/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Arrays have access to built-in methods that allow us to manipulate arrays and the elements they hold. 

  * 🔑 Array methods are easy to use. We simply use the name of the array, followed by a dot `.`, and the name of the method with parentheses `()`. The `sort()` method, shown in the following example, sorts the elements in an array in alphabetical and ascending order:

    ```js
    comparisonOperators.sort();
    ```

  * 🔑 Some array methods take arguments. We put the argument value in the parentheses `()`. The `push()` method attaches the value placed in the parentheses `()` at the end of an array, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    arithmeticOperators.push("%");
    ```

  * 🔑 Array methods can also return a new array. The `slice()` method returns a slice of an array as a new array. The arguments determine which indexes to use to start and end the slice. You can see the following statement for an example:

    ```js
    var logicalOperatorsSliced = logicalOperators.slice(0,2);
    ```

  * 🔑 Strings also have methods. The `replace()` method will return a new string. In that new string, `"String"` is replaced with `"World"`. You can see this at work in the following example:

    ```js
    var myNewString = myString.replace("String", "World");
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are array methods useful for?

  * 🙋 They give us access to a wide range of functionality when writing code.

  * ☝️ What is an array method? 

  * 🙋 An array method is a built-in method that we can use to manipulate arrays and the elements stored in them. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Student Do: Methods (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in`20-Stu_Methods/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📖 Implement Array and String Methods

  Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

  * As a developer, I want to use array methods to add and remove elements from an array and join two arrays.

  * As a developer, I want to use a string method to return a new string that contains only capital letters. 

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the string `"Canis Major"` is added as the first element of the `constellations` array and no elements are removed. 

  * It's done when `"Venus"` is removed from the `planets` array.

  * It's done when the arrays `constellations` and `planets` are joined to form a new array named `galaxy`. The arrays `constellations` and `planets` should not be altered.

  * It's done when the string `"polaris"` is converted into all capital letters and the new string is stored in a variable.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MDN Web Docs on array instance methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Instance_methods)

  [MDN Web Docs on string instance methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods)

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What happens when you use `typeof` on an array? What is returned? Is that what you expected? Why or why not? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this. 
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: Methods (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with array and string methods? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `unshift()`
  
  * ✔️ `pop()`

  * ✔️ `concat()`

  * ✔️ `toUpperCase()`

* Open `20-Stu_Methods/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We use the `unshift()` array method to add an element to the beginning of the `constellation` array. The value added to the array goes inside the parentheses `()`, like in the following example:

    ```js
    constellations.unshift("Canis Major");
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the `pop()` method to remove the last element in the planets array, as follows:

    ```js
    planets.pop();
    ```

  * 🔑 To join two arrays, we use the `concat()` method. This method, shown in the following example, returns a new array named `galaxy`:

    ```js
    var galaxy = constellations.concat(planets);
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the string method `toUpperCase()`, shown in the following example, to return the new string `"POLARIS"`:

    ```js
    var upperCaseStar = star.toUpperCase();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we use array and string methods to supercharge code?

  * 🙋 Array methods are a quick and easy way to add elements, remove elements, join two arrays, and do much, much more. String methods are also a powerful way to manipulate strings. With both array and string methods, we can implement powerful functionality in just a single line of code.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on array instance methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Instance_methods) and the [MDN Web Docs on string instance methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
