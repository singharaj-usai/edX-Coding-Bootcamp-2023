# 03.3 Weekday Lesson Plan: Objects

## Overview

In today's class, students will learn about objects, object methods, and the keyword `this`. Local Git branching, `checkout`, and merging will be introduced as well. This lesson also includes a group mini-project aimed at reinforcing and building on foundational JavaScript skills.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Objects` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be sure to review the activities and try to anticipate questions that students might ask.

* The last hour of class will be devoted to the Rock, Paper, Scissors mini-project. In addition to applying the fundamentals covered in class, students will research the `window` methods `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` on their own and find a way to randomize the computer's selection. Encourage students to use pseudocoding as a problem-solving tool if they feel overwhelmed. They can also refer to the documentation provided in `28-Stu_Mini-Project\README.md`.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

  * Define and use JavaScript objects.

  * Use JavaScript object methods.

  * Explain and use the `this` keyword.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Inform students that at the end of today's class they will work together to build an interactive game with JavaScript.

* Tell the students that coding games can help them hone their skills as developers. However, writing code for games was not always as simple as it is today!

* Open [SpaceWars!](https://spacewar.oversigma.com/) in your browser and explain the following:

  * SpaceWars! is a simple game that allows two users to input information to interact. The goal is to destroy the other user's spaceship.

  * Back in the early '60s, it took Stephen Russell, Peter Samson, Dan Edwards, and Martin Graetz over 200 hours and 40 pages of code to create SpaceWars!&mdash;credited as the first interactive computer game.

  * We can still see the game run&mdash;as originally coded&mdash;using this emulator written in JavaScript.

* Open [Play SpaceWars!](https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We can also play this remake of the game online.

  * The game uses letters to input users' choices. The W, A, S, and D keys control one of the spaceships. The I, J, K, and L keys control the other.

  * Different actions are performed based on the user input. If the user enters W, the ship spins one way. If A is entered, the ship spins the other way.

  * The game is ended when a specific condition is met&mdash;when one of the ships is destroyed.

* Inform the students that while technologies have certainly changed, the logic pioneered by MIT scientists is much the same as the logic we will use to build the interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game at the end of class.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Objects (5 min)

* Open `21-Ins_Objects/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë JavaScript **objects** are a lot like objects in real life. They are things that have distinct characteristics or properties. For this first JavaScript object, the thing we will create is a planet.

  * üîë We use object literal notation to create the `planet` object, and we use curly brackets `{}` to hold the values, as follows:

    ```js
    var planet = {};
    ```

  * üîë We use key-value pairs to give the properties a name and a value, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    name: "Earth"
    ```

  * üîë Objects usually have many related properties that help to define the object, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var planet = {
      name: "Earth",
      age: "4.543 billion years",
      moons: 1,
      isPopulated: true,
      population: "7.594 billion"
    };
    ```

  * üîë To access the value stored in a property, we use dot notation, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log(planet.name);
    ```

  * üîë We can also use bracket notation to access a value. When we use bracket notation, the key goes in quotes, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(planet["name"]);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è When would we want to use an object in JavaScript?

  * üôã When we want to create an unordered collection of properties that describe a particular thing.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do we access a value stored in an object?

  * üôã We use dot notation and bracket notation. Both use the object's name and the associated key.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we used bracket notation before?

  * üôã We used bracket notation with arrays.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Student Do: Objects (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Objects/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Log Customer's Drink Order Using an Object

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a coffee shop owner, I want to store data about my customer's drink order in an object and log a message indicating whether the drink is ready or still in the queue.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the `customerOrder` object has three properties that store the drink's name, the number of sugars, and a Boolean indicating whether the order is ready.

  * It's done when the drink name and the number of sugars is logged to the console.

  * It's done when, if the order is ready, the message `"Ready for pick-up"` logs.

  * It's done when, if the order is not ready, the message `"Still in order queue"` logs.

  ## üí° Hints

  How can we use dot notation or bracket notation to access an object's values?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is a `for...in` statement? How can you use it to iterate over an object‚Äôs properties?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Objects (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel using objects? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Object literal

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Key-value pairs

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Dot notation

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Bracket notation

* Open `22-Objects/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We declare a `customerDrink` object using object literal notation. We give the object three properties, as follows:

    ```js
    var customerDrink = {
      name: "coffee",
      sugars: 3,
      isReady: true
    };
    ```

  * üîë We use key-value pairs to define each property, like in the following example:

    ```js
    name: "coffee"
    ```

  * To access the whole object, we use the object's name, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log(customerDrink);
    ```

  * üîë We use dot notation to access a value stored in a key-value pair, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    if (customerDrink.isReady) {
      console.log("Ready for pick-up: " + customerDrink.name + " with " + customerDrink.sugars + " sugars.");
    }
    ```

  * üîë We can also use bracket notation to access a value, as follows:

    ```js
    else {
      console.log("Still in order queue: " + customerDrink["name"] + " with " + customerDrink["sugars"] + " sugars.");
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are key-value pairs used in objects?

  * üôã The key is a unique identifier used to access the value. In objects, key-value pairs define the properties of an object.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Object Methods (5 min)

* Open `23-Ins_Object-Methods/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë An object's properties can also hold lists of values or even functions, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    var planet = {
      name: "Earth",
      age: "4.543 billion years",
      moons: 1,
      isPopulated: true,
      population: "7.594 billion",
      neighboringPlanets: ["Mars", "Venus"],
      tellFunFact: function () {
        console.log("The earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a Roman god or goddess.");
      },
      showWarning: function () {
        console.log("Space junk falls into Earth's atmosphere at a rate of about one a day.");
      }
    };
    ```

  * üîë We use arrays to store lists of values in key-value pairs, as follows:

    ```js
    neighboringPlanets: ["Mars", "Venus"]
    ```

  * üîë To access an element in an array contained in an object, we can use the object's name and key, plus the index of the element&mdash;as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(planet.neighboringPlanets[0]);
    console.log(planet["neighboringPlanets"][0]);
    ```

  * üîë To declare a method, we assign a key. A **method** is simply a function associated with an object. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    tellFunFact: function () {
      console.log("The earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a Roman god or goddess.");
    },
    showWarning: function () {
      console.log("Space junk falls into Earth's atmosphere at a rate of about one a day.");
    }
    ```

  * üîë To call or invoke an object's method, we use the object's name followed by the assigned key. Don't forget the `()`, shown in the following example:

    ```js
    planet.tellFunFact();
    planet.showWarning();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is a method?

  * üôã A method is a function associated with an object. It is also a property of the object.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Student Do: Object Methods (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Objects-Methods/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üêõ Messages Not Logging to Console

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

  * Users should see a message log to the console indicating whether the shelter dog or cat is available.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When a name is stored in the `chosenPet` variable, a message should log to the console indicating whether the pet is available and whether it is a dog or a cat. If the pet is not available, a message should indicate that and suggest the shelter's featured cat and dog. No errors should be returned.

  ## Actual Behavior

  No message is logged to the console, and an error message indicating an `Uncaught ReferenceError` is returned.

  ## üí° Hints

  Look at each console log. What is the intended input? How can you use the object name and key to access the values and methods you need to make the code work?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can you convert an object into an array using `Object.values()`?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Object Methods (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with object methods? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `shelter.dogMessage();`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `shelter.dogs`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `shelter.dogs[0]`

* Open `24-Stu_Object-Methods/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The `chosenPet` variable holds the name of the chosen pet, as follows:

    ```js
    var chosenPet = "Lulu";
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do we use keys to access an object's properties?

  * üôã We first use the object's name. Then we use the key to identify the data we want to access.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on working with objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: this (5 min)

* Open `25-Ins_Object-This/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we log the keyword `this`, the `window` object is logged.

  * üîë The `window` object represents the browser's open window and has many properties, including methods.

* Open `25-Ins_Object-This/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * The `this` keyword refers an object. The global object is the open browser window. You can see `this` at work in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(this);
    ```

  * When we use `this` inside an object like `planet`, the keyword `this` belongs to that object and is used to refer to the object's properties, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    logFacts: function () {
      console.log("This planet's name is " + this.name);
      console.log("This planet's age is " + this.age);
    }
    ```

  * When we call an object's method, `this` refers to the object that the method belongs to. Because `logPopulation` belongs to the `planet` object in the following example, `this` refers to `planet`:

    ```js
    logPopulation: function () {
      if (this.isPopulated) {
        console.log("This planet's population is " + this.population);
      } else {
        console.log("The planet is unpopulated");
      }
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does the keyword `this` refer to?

  * üôã The keyword `this` refers to the object it belongs to. If `this` is not inside another object, it refers to the global object, or `window`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Student Do: this (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26_Stu_Object-This/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìê Add Comments to Implementation of this

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/script.js).

  ## Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MDN Web Docs on this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * JavaScript has its own built-in `Math` object with mathematical functions we can use. How can we combine `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` to randomly select an element from an array? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (10 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: this (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the keyword `this`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `this` in global context

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `this` in local context

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `this` in object method

* Open `26-Stu_Object_This/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë When we log the keyword `this` alone&mdash;like in the following example&mdash;the global object, or `window`, is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(this);
    ```

  * When we use `this` inside a function, `this` refers to the global object, as follows:

    ```js
    function helloThis() {
      console.log("Inside this function, this is " + this);
    }
    ```

  * üîë When we use `this` inside an object, `this` is local and belongs to that object, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var child = {
      age: 10,
      ageTenYears: function() {
        console.log(this.age + 10);
      }
    };
    ```

  * üîë When we use `this` in a nested object, `this` refers to the object where it is used even if it is inside another object, like in the following example:

    ```js
    var investor = {
      name: "Cash Saver",
      investment: {
      initialInvestment: 5000,
      investmentGrowth: function() {
        console.log(this.initialInvestment * 1.15)
        }
      }
    };
    ```

  * üîë When we call an object's method, `this` still refers to the object the method belongs to&mdash;even when it is called outside the object, like in the following code:

    ```js
    child.ageTenYears();
    investor.investment.investmentGrowth();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the global object?

  * üôã The global object is the object that exists in the global scope. The `window` object is the global object.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does the keyword `this` refer to inside an object?

  * üôã The keyword `this` refers to the object.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Branch/README.md`.

### 12. Everyone Do: Git Branching and Merging (10 min)

* Open the [Atlassian guide to using branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) in your browser and explain the following:

  * When we work on new features or bug fixes, or when we work in a collaborative environment, it is not a good idea to work directly in the `main` branch.

  * Using Git, we can create a copy of the `main` branch and then work in a different branch. Doing so enables us to work in isolation, without messing up the codebase.

  * In this activity, we'll explore the `git branch`, `git checkout`, and `git merge` commands and how we can use them to work in different branches and merge branches locally.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Branch/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We can create a new branch to work in, as shown in the following code, but it doesn't immediately take us to that new branch:

    ```bash
    git branch <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * üîë If we want to move into that branch to work, we use the `checkout` command, as follows:

    ```bash
    git checkout <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * üîë Alternatively, we can create a branch and `checkout` into it simultaneously, as follows:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * üîë When we finish making changes in the branch, we commit the work to it and `checkout` back to the branch we want this new code to be merged to, then we merge it with the following command:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'commit message'

    git checkout main
    git merge <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * When we're done, we can keep the feature branch or delete it, as follows:

    ```bash
    git branch -d <name-of-branch>
    ```

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project (5 min)

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows a user to play against the computer.

  * üîë When we open the browser, we are prompted to enter a choice: R, P, or S.

  * üîë When we have entered the letter and pressed OK, we are alerted to the computer's choice.

  * üîë After we press OK, we are alerted whether we won, tied, or lost.

  * üîë When we press OK again, we are alerted to the stats.

  * üîë When we press OK a final time, we are presented with the prompt "Play Again?"

  * üîë If we press OK, the game starts again. If not, we exit the game.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã Start with a plan! Pseudocoding will help us figure out what the code will need to look like. Then, using the JavaScript skills learned in class and a bit of research, we will write the actual code.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini-project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (45 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Module 03 Mini-Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

  In this activity, you will work with a group to build a game using only JavaScript.

  The completed application should meet the following criteria:

  * As a user, I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.

  * As a user, I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.

  * As a user, I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.

  * As a user, I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.

  * As a user, I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after each round.

  ### Specifications

  * Must use the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` methods to collect user input and display information to the user.

  * The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.

  ## üí° Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  * [MDN Web Docs on window.alert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert)

  * [MDN Web Docs on window.confirm()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm)

  * [MDN Web Docs on window.prompt()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt)

  * [MDN Web Docs on Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math)

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your group to further your knowledge:

  * How can you customize the appearance of the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` dialog boxes?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project  (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `window.prompt()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `window.alert()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Conditional statements

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `window.confirm()`

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We declare variables that will be used to count the wins, losses, and ties, as follows:

    ```js
    var wins = 0;
    var ties = 0;
    var losses = 0;
    ```

  * We also create an array to hold all the possible choices the computer can make, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var options = ["R", "P", "S"];
    ```

  * üîë To play the game, the user has to enter a choice. We use `window.prompt()` to grab the choice and store it in a variable, as follows:

    ```js
    var userChoice = window.prompt("Enter R, P, or S:");
    ```

  * To compare with the computer's pick, the `userChoice` must be capital letters. So we use a string method, shown in the following example, to ensure that all choices are uppercase:

    ```js
    userChoice = userChoice.toUpperCase();
    ```

  * üîë We use `Math.floor()` combined with `Math.Random()` to select a random index from the `options` array, as follows:

    ```js
    var index = Math.floor(Math.random() * options.length);
    ```

  * üîë The `index` is then used to assign the computer a choice, as follows:

    ```js
    var computerChoice = options[index];
    ```

  * üîë We use `window.alert()` to alert the user of the computer's pick in the browser, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    window.alert("The computer chose " + computerChoice);
    ```

  * üîë We use conditional statements to determine whether the game is a tie, win, or loss.

  * If the `userChoice` and `computerChoice` are equal, then it is a tie. We increment `tie` and alert the user that `"It's a tie!"`, as follows:

    ```js
    if (userChoice === computerChoice) {
      ties++;
      window.alert("It's a tie!");
    }
    ```

  * If it is not a tie, we check whether the user has won, with the following code:

    ```js
    else if (
      (userChoice === "R" && computerChoice === "S") ||
      (userChoice === "P" && computerChoice === "R") ||
      (userChoice === "S" && computerChoice === "P")
    ) {
      wins++;
      window.alert("You win!");
    }
    ```

  * If it is not a tie or a win, then we alert the user that it is a loss and increment `losses`, as follows:

    ```js
    else {
      losses++;
      window.alert("You lost!");
    }
    ```

  * We use an alert to show the user the stats. In the following example, `\n` creates line breaks:

    ```js
    window.alert(
      "Stats:\nWins: " + wins + "\nLosses: " + losses + "\nTies: " + ties
    );
    ```

  * We use `window.confirm()` to determine whether the user wants to play again, as follows:

    ```js
    var playAgain = window.confirm("Play again?");
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can users interact with the Rock, Paper, Scissors game?

  * üôã Users interact through a series of pop-up boxes that prompt them to provide a choice, share a message, or confirm whether they want to play again. The `window` methods used to create these pop-up boxes are `window.alert()`, `window.confirm()`, and `window.prompt()`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôãWe can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on window.prompt()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt), the [MDN Web Docs on window.confirm()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm), and the [MDN Web Docs on window.alert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
