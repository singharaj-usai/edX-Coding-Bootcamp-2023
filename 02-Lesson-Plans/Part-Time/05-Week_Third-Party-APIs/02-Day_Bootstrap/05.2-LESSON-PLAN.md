# 05.2 Weekday Lesson Plan: CSS Frameworks with Bootstrap and Google Fonts

## Overview 

This class introduces Bootstrap, the concepts of a CSS framework, and Google Fonts. Students will rely heavily on documentation to build webpages using prebuilt UI components, the Bootstrap grid system, and utility classes, and they will customize those pages with Google Fonts and CSS.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `11-Ins_Bootstrap-Components` through `20-Stu_Google-Fonts`.

* **Important**: Our curriculum currently uses Bootstrap v4.5! Please refer to the Bootstrap v4.5 [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) instead of `https://getbootstrap.com` as that will navigate to version 5+.

* Take a few minutes before class to get familiar with both the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) documentation, as students will rely heavily on these resources in class and might need a nudge in finding answers.

* It's important that students understand that Bootstrap is simply a large stylesheet and that it uses a lot of skills they already have. If students are struggling with certain concepts, try and jog their memory of learning CSS and emphasize the use of DevTools to break down styles being used.

* Reiterate often that, like CSS, using Bootstrap classes and Google Fonts requires a bit of trial and error to achieve the intended design and layout. Encourage students to try using different variations of classes and fonts to become more comfortable with the process and learn more about their personal tastes.

* Emphasize that whenever we use a new library, framework, or technology, it's best that we familiarize ourselves with the documentation as much as possible.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice but instead  is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module, for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to do the following:

* Explain the concept of CSS frameworks.

* Build webpages using prebuilt Bootstrap UI components.

* Optimize page layouts using Bootstrap's responsive grid system and utility classes.

* Customize pages built with Bootstrap to use custom color themes and Google Fonts.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Remind students that this module is all about using third-party APIs and libraries to make development work easier at times.

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answer (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What purpose does jQuery serve?

  * üôã It is a library that can make working with the DOM a little easier at times.

* Explain that in this class, we will learn about a CSS framework called **Bootstrap**.

* Liken Bootstrap to jQuery, but for CSS instead of JavaScript. 

* Explain that Bootstrap is a **CSS Framework** and is essentially a very large stylesheet that offers a lot of solutions for layout and design needs&mdash;reducing the amount of custom CSS that developers need to create for their apps.

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answer (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we learn about getting started using Bootstrap?

  * üôã By visiting the documentation!

* Open the [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) and then select the Get Started button to open the documentation.

* Walk through the Quick Start section of the page, explaining the CSS file and three JavaScript/jQuery dependencies. We don't always need the `<script>` tags for our app to work, but they're needed for certain offerings that Bootstrap provides.

* Briefly touch on how Bootstrap can be thought of in three main solutions:

  * **Components:** Bootstrap offers prebuilt UI components like form elements, alert dialogs, and navigation bars.

  * **Layout:** Bootstrap has a prebuilt grid system that allows us to create responsive layouts with ease.

  * **Utilities:** Bootstrap offers a series of utility styles that allow us to adjust a number of CSS properties, like margin, padding, colors, and sizing.

* Explain that all of this is built using CSS properties that we already know; Bootstrap has simply done a lot of the work for us. All we have to do is learn how to apply their prebuilt CSS classes, and we can use their styles! This can save developers valuable time when working on long, intense projects.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Components (5 min)

* Open `11-Ins_Bootstrap-Components/index.html` in your browser and walk through each example:

  * üîë The main page uses Bootstrap buttons to link us to each component page.

  * üîë The Navbar page shows three (of many) variations that Bootstrap provides. The dropdown menu capability and responsive hamburger menu icon need the three `<script>` elements we saw earlier.

  * üîë The Cards page shows two variations of a popular component called a card. They can be used for a list of blog posts, products in a store, sidebar content, and a lot more.

  * üîë The Forms page demonstrates how form elements look using Bootstrap.

  * üîë The Bootstrap layout and utility classes were used in each page to achieve a responsive centered layout with differing background colors.

* Open `11-Ins_Bootstrap-Components/index.html` in your IDE and point out the following:

  * üîë The Bootstrap CDN `<link>`

  * üîë The use of multiple classes provided by Bootstrap

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where can we go to learn more about each of these components?

  * üôã The Bootstrap documentation!

* Reiterate that whenever we use a new library, framework, or technology, it's best that we familiarize ourselves with the documentation as much as possible.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Bootstrap-Components/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Bootstrap Components (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Bootstrap-Components/README.md`

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìñ Add Bootstrap Components to the Page

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to quickly put together a webpage without having to write custom CSS.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the page has a styled navbar.

  * It's done when the page has a styled jumbotron.

  * It's done when the page has a styled and dismissible alert box.

  * It's done when the page has a styled form.

  * It's done when the page has a styled list with badges.

  * It's done when the page has a styled card with a list, header, and footer.

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the following documentation: 

  [Bootstrap documentation on components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/)

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ---

  ## üí°Hints

  * When in doubt, use the Bootstrap documentation links in the comments and Chrome DevTools to break down the classes and styles used!

  * Look down the left-hand side of the Bootstrap documentation to see the different types of components.

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * How did Bootstrap come to be, and how are CSS frameworks like it useful for developers? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Components (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with Bootstrap components? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è The documentation has everything we need.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Bootstrap provides all of the classes.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Some components rely on the Bootstrap JavaScript to work.

* Open `12-Stu_Bootstrap-Components/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë Everything implemented here can be found in the documentation and sample code.

  * üîë Each component works by using classes that are defined in the Bootstrap stylesheet. Scroll down to the Card HTML:

    ```html
    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="card-header">This is a card.</h4>
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's
          content.</p>
      </div>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">Cras justo odio</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Dapibus ac facilisis in</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Vestibulum at eros</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="card-body">
        <a href="#" class="card-link">Card link</a>
        <a href="#" class="card-link">Another link</a>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

  * Most of these classes need to work in unison to show the result in the browser.

  * üîë Some components rely on HTML data attributes and JavaScript to work as well, like the responsive hamburger icon navbar toggling the menu to open and close on click.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone look at how these styles are used in Chrome DevTools?

  * üôã You'll notice that it's all the regular CSS properties we already know; the team at Bootstrap just spent a lot more time planning it out for us.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before introducing the next demo.

* Ask the class the following question to help transition to the next demo:

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Do we think we're making good use of space with this layout?

  * üôã Most likely not; we might want to create some left and right columns to help put more content higher up on the page.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Layout (5 min) 

* Open `13-Ins_Bootstrap-Layout/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We can create a 12-column grid layout with Bootstrap classes.

  * üîë We can even control what width they will be on different screen sizes and use justification and alignment classes to reposition them.

* Open `13-Ins_Bootstrap-Layout/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë A grid layout is created by using the `row` class in the container and `col-*` classes for different column sizes on different screens.

  * üîë The page margins are created using the `container` and `container-fluid` classes. The `container` class has a maximum width applied, and `container-fluid` will grow with the page no matter how wide.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What CSS tool have we used in the past to achieve these types of layouts?

  * üôã flexbox!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è And what other CSS tool did we combine flexbox properties with to make a responsive page layout?

  * üôã Media queries.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Bootstrap-Layout/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Bootstrap Layout (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Bootstrap-Layout/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìñ Implement Responsive Layout

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to create a responsive layout without having to write custom CSS.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the page displays a multicolumn layout on large screens and matches the mock-up provided.

  * It's done when the screen displays in a single-column layout on smaller screens and matches how it looks currently.

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the following documentation: 

  [Bootstrap documentation on the grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/)

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The webpage layout features multiple rows and columns using Bootstrap's grid system.](./Images/01-solved-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hint

  * Don't forget to use the previous activity as a guide to how the classes can be used!

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

  * What are some ways Chrome DevTools can demystify the CSS powering the grid? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Layout (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel building layouts in Bootstrap? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `col-*` needs to be direct child of `row`.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è It's mobile-first. Use breakpoints to go up, not down.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We don't need to take up the full width.

* Open `14-Stu_Bootstrap-Layout/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë Every grid layout we create starts with an HTML element receiving a class of `row` and turns it into a flexbox layout. 
  
  * üîë Walk through this portion of the solution HTML to explain the column sizing at different breakpoints and the grid alignment with `align-items-end`:

    ```html
    <div class="row align-items-end">
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="https://placehold.it/1920x1080" alt="video placeholder" />
        </div>

        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
          <h1>Welcome to the app.</h1>
          <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Perspiciatis, reprehenderit! Placeat quo
          necessitatibus porro corporis quasi architecto sit aspernatur inventore, perspiciatis nulla hic soluta ipsum
          ipsa sed iure dolorum! Tenetur? Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ex voluptatem
          dolorum earum esse recusandae facere aliquam. Excepturi facilis sint nesciunt ipsa, eveniet facere in quidem
          voluptas exercitationem distinctio commodi laborum!</p>
          <button class="btn btn-primary">Learn more.</button>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

  * üîë When we don't want to have a column take up the full width, we can center-justify the row's contents and set the column to be smaller on larger screen sizes.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do the `-sm`, `-md`, and `-lg` in the class names do for us? 

  * üôã They instruct the columns to be different sizes on different screen widths using media queries.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone find anything interesting in the documentation that we didn't use here? 

  * üôã We can automatically size columns with simple `col` classes and reorder them, amongst many other things!

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Bootstrap documentation on the grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/), and stay for office hours to ask for help. Use the Bootstrap examples provided in the documentation to give yourself a starting point, then continue to tweak the class names to try and configure different layouts. Having a good understanding of CSS flexbox properties will ultimately be the best way to learn it too. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next demo.

* Ask the class the following question to help transition to the next demo:

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we make this more vibrant and less tight feeling?

  * üôã We can use custom CSS, or we can look at Bootstrap utility classes and see what's offered.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Utilities (5 min) 

* Open `15-Ins_Bootstrap-Utilities/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë This is the same page as before, but we use Bootstrap utility classes to add some different colors.

* Open `15-Ins_Bootstrap-Utilities/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë To achieve this updated design, we simply add in Bootstrap utility classes.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we change the color of an HTML element without changing its existing style definition? 

  * üôã Add another class to it that defines that color style.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Bootstrap-Utilities/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Bootstrap Utilities (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Bootstrap-Utilities/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  # üìñ Adjust Positioning and Styling on the Page

  Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to center the form on the page horizontally and vertically using no custom CSS.

  * As a developer, I want to be able to adjust and add style to the page without writing any custom CSS.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the main content on the page is centered horizontally and vertically on the page.

  * It's done when the background color of the page is dark.

  * It's done when the background color of the form is white.

  * It's done when the text color of the header on the page is white.

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the following documentation (look for Utilities in the left navigation menu): 

  [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![A white form is centered on the page with a dark background.](./Images/01-solved-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hint

  * Don't forget to use the previous examples and activities as a guide to how the classes can be used!

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner: 

  * Using Chrome DevTools, what can you do to make this look more personalized? Try updating some of the more generic styles to use different colors or font sizes.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Utilities (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel using Bootstrap utility classes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è More single-purpose classes to achieve a result.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Change colors to create contrast.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Proper sizing and spacing goes a long way.

* Open `16-Stu_Bootstrap-Utilities/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We can center a page's content vertically and horizontally by making the page have a minimum height set to the height of the page and making it a flexbox:

    ```html
    <div class="min-vh-100 d-flex align-items-center bg-dark">
    ```

  * üîë Bootstrap has a list of preset color classes for backgrounds and text, which can be helpful when we need some contrast on a page.

  * üîë The spacing properties for margin and padding can be extremely useful to create or remove space in areas instead of needing to use custom CSS.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Which class was used to center the content vertically on the page, `justify-content-center` or `align-items-center`?

  * üôã `align-items-center`, because the term "align" is used when adjusting flexbox elements vertically in a row.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where do we think Bootstrap falls a bit short and requires us to build custom styles?

  * üôã The colors are preset, so we would need to use our own if we wanted to change them.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Extending Bootstrap (5 min) 

* Open `17-Ins_Bootstrap-Extend/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * üîë This page is using all Bootstrap components, but with custom colors instead of the default Bootstrap colors.

    * üîë This is great for when we want to use Bootstrap for handling layout and certain design aspects but still need to provide a custom theme or branding.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we add custom CSS styles?

    * üôã Apply custom classes to the HTML elements and create our own style rules.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_Bootstrap-Extend/README.md`.

### 13. Student Do: Extending Bootstrap (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_Bootstrap-Extend/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üèó Add Custom Styles to the Page 

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to visit a site that uses a custom color theme and branding.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the page is not utilizing the generic colors provided by Bootstrap.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![A guestbook webpage features custom colors instead of the built-in colors provided by Bootstrap.](./Images/01-solved-screenshot.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * There is a color theme already available to use in `style.css`, but feel free to use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/).

  * Don't forget to use the previous example as a guide to how custom styles can be applied with CSS.

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner: 

  * What are some other UI frameworks that we could use? 

  To get started, try [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), and a very customizable one called [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 14. Instructor Review: Extending Bootstrap (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel customizing Bootstrap with CSS? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Add our own stylesheet.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Just add another class to the HTML element.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Use Bootstrap for layout and spacing but custom CSS for colors and fonts.

* Open `18-Stu_Bootstrap-Extend/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë It's important that the stylesheet's `<link>` comes last in the HTML file, so that the styles aren't overridden.

  * üîë We can add our own classes to elements with Bootstrap classes to add custom CSS rules to them.

* Open `18-Stu_Bootstrap-Extend/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We were able to add custom classes to both existing HTML and any HTML created as a result of the form being submitted:

    ```js
    var cardName = $('<h5>').addClass('card-header custom-card-header').text(name);
    ```

* Remind students that Bootstrap is simply a framework with a lot of popular style needs handled for us, but not all. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è If we needed to, could we use our own custom CSS for sizing and layout purposes alongside Bootstrap?

  * üôã Yes! But we need to be careful not to use the same class names.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Do we think it's a good idea to mix Bootstrap and custom CSS?

  * üôã Yes, Bootstrap is great for handling a lot of layout needs but looks generic on its own. We can, and should, add as much extra styling as we need to in order to achieve the desired result. If you find yourself making too many overriding styles, though, you might want to consider a different or custom solution.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, check DevTools to determine what styles are needed, and stay for office hours to ask for help. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next demo.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Google Fonts (5 min) 

* Remind students how each computer has a default set of fonts that we can pick from, but over the years some services have emerged to help with providing more options.

* Open `19-Ins_Google-Fonts/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë This page uses fonts that aren't native to our computers; they actually come from Google Fonts.

  * üîë With the use of web fonts like this, we can add even more customization and branding to an application!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we learn how to use Google Fonts?

  * üôã By reading their documentation.

* Navigate to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) in your browser and walk through the interface.

* Be sure to demonstrate how to select fonts and use the embed code.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_Google-Fonts/README.md`.

### 16. Student Do: Google Fonts (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_Google-Fonts/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

* Let them know this is a bit more open-ended of an activity, and students should feel encouraged to find and implement fonts of their choosing. This is all about learning how to implement web fonts, not necessarily which ones are right. 

  ```md
  # üìñ Add Custom Font to Page with Google Fonts

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to view a customized and well-designed page that uses custom colors and fonts.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the page's body text uses fonts loaded from Google Fonts and not the default Bootstrap fonts.

  * It's done when the page's headings text uses fonts loaded from Google Fonts and not the default Bootstrap fonts. 

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the following documentation: 

  [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

  ## üí° Hints

  * Remember, this is an open-ended activity! Work with your partner to find interesting fonts of your choosing. There is no right or wrong answer to this activity.

  * There are websites that can help you pick fonts if you are overwhelmed by the options. Visit [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/google-fonts) and [FontPair](https://fontpair.co/) for inspiration!

  * Don't forget to use typographic CSS properties to adjust font weights and italics if you need to!

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner: 

  * How does Google develop their typography? 

  You can read [Google‚Äôs design blog](https://design.google/library/google-fonts/) to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: Google Fonts (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel using Google Fonts? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points (‚úîÔ∏è):

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We need to start by finding a font or fonts that we want to use.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Use the `<link>` provided.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Don't pick too many fonts or , for performance reasons.

* Open `20-Stu_Google-Fonts/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë It's important that we start by finding a font or fonts that we want to use, but not too many variations.

  * üîë We need to ensure that the Google Font `<link>` comes before our own custom stylesheet so that the fonts are loaded before we put them to use:

    ```html
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Karla&family=Rubik:wght@700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    ```

  * We'll learn more about what the URL in the `href` value means in future lessons. All we need to know for now is that the URL holds the data needed for us to use those fonts in the stylesheet.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone pick a font that used italics or thin/thick variations? If yes, what CSS properties did you have to use?

  * üôã `font-style` for italic, `font-weight` for thin/thick variations.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Google Fonts documentation](https://developers.google.com/fonts/), and stay for office hours to ask for help. Like all things CSS, it's just about putting it to practice. There are also a few links included in the activity's readme to help with picking the right font.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the end of class.

* Offer encouragement that most of what we learned today builds on things we've learned in the past. The most important thing to remember with third-party libraries is reading the documentation!

* In preparation for the class, encourage students to practice a little bit more with Bootstrap and gain familiarity with how to use Google Fonts.
