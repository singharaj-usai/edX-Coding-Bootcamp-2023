# Module 05 Instructor Overview: Third-Party APIs

## Overview

In this module, you will implement CDNs to leverage third-party APIs, like CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, and custom fonts. You will use jQuery to perform DOM manipulation, implement Bootstrap and Google Fonts, and introduce jQuery UI and Moment.js.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's Challenge.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Expect students to have many issues with jQuery syntax. Be encouraging and let them know that the syntax will seem more intuitive over time. For now, they should just try to use the syntax as is.

* Take a few minutes before class to get familiar with the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) and the [Google Fonts documentation](https://fonts.google.com), as students will rely heavily on both resources in class and may need a nudge in finding answers.

* 05.3 lesson plan includes an activity that involves the `Moment.js` library. `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers. We will still use it in this module, but feel free to refer the students to other libraries, such as:

  * [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/)

  * [Day.js](https://day.js.org/)

  * [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)

  * [js-Joda](https://js-joda.github.io/js-joda/)

* The 05.3 lesson plan also includes an Everyone Do: Git activity. If the students struggle with that activity, walk through it with them using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

* Remind students to complete this module's assessment near the end of the week. Students can find it in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

The next module will cover server-side APIs. It is recommended that you try to fill any conceptual holes students have about JavaScript objects during this module.
