# 06.2 Weekday Lesson Plan: Server-Side APIs

## Overview 

* Most of today's activities pick up where you left off last time, using `fetch()` with the GitHub API. You will also introduce students to the Chrome DevTools Network tab, the `response` object, and the `document.location` Web API method.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `11-Ins_Network_Activity` through `20-Stu_Documentation_Location`.

* Before class, be sure to read over the activities and try to anticipate any questions that students might have. Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the [MDN Web Docs on Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) and the [Google documentation on inspecting network activity](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network).

* Remind students throughout class that all of this will get easier as they gain familiarity with the GitHub API documentation and using `fetch()`.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use the Chrome DevTools Network tab.

* Implement and use the `Response` object from a `fetch()` request.

* Implement deconstructed parameters in an API request URL.

* Implement `fetch()` options for a `fetch()` request.

* Use `document.location` to replace the URL in the browser.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Explain that we will be building on the previous day's activities and will continue to use the Fetch API by learning how to create complex `fetch()` requests. We will also learn about some options available to help us debug fetch requests.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When something goes wrong with a `fetch()` request, how do we find out what the issue was?

  * 🙋 We can use the `Response` object and the Chrome DevTools Network tab to help us find out what went wrong.

  * ☝️ When trying to debug a problem, what would be a good first step towards solving it?

  * 🙋 We could use search engines like Google, tech forums like Stack Overflow, or even do some **rubber duck debugging**. (This method involves stating the problem out loud, to oneself or to an inanimate object like a rubber duck. Sometimes vocalizing the issue brings about an aha moment!)

* Open the [MDN Web Docs on Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) in your browser and scroll to Properties, then explain the following:

  * When we make a `fetch()` request, we receive a `Response` object back. That object contains methods that allow us to parse out particular pieces of data.
  
* Select the `Response.status` property, and scroll down to the following coded example:

  ```js
  var myImage = document.querySelector('img');

  var myRequest = new Request('flowers.jpg');

  fetch(myRequest).then(function(response) {
    console.log(response.status); // returns 200
    response.blob().then(function(myBlob) {
        var objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(myBlob);
        myImage.src = objectURL;
    });
  });
  ```

  * We can use the `response.status` method to receive a **status code**.

  * HTTP response status codes can tell us whether a request was a success or failure.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we learn more about the `Response` object and status codes?

  * 🙋 We can visit the [MDN Web Docs on HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) or the [MDN Web Docs on Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)!
  
### 2. Instructor Demo: Network Activity Tab (5 min) 

* Open `11-Ins_Network_Activity/index.html` in your browser to the Network tab and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Press Command+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Widows) to record the reload.

  * 🔑 The Network tab records the loading of local and remote resources.

  * 🔑 The status codes indicate whether these resources came through successfully or not.

  * 🔑 Status codes will quickly let us know what happened with a particular request.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the Network tab useful for?

  * 🙋 It allows us to track requests and resources to and from applications.

  * ☝️ How do we learn about using the Network tab?

  * 🙋 The Chrome DevTools documentation.

* Reiterate that whenever students use a new library, framework, or technology, it's best to familiarize themselves with the documentation as much as possible.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Network_Activity/index.html`.

### 3. Student Do: Network Activity Tab (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Network_Activity/index.html`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🐛 Error Appears in the Chrome DevTools Network Tab

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

  ## 💡 Hints

  How are JavaScript files usually loaded by an HTML page?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What other features are available in the Chrome DevTools Network tab?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra.

### 4. Instructor Review: Network Tab (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel using the Network  tab? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Network tab

  * ✔️ Status codes

  * ✔️ Debugging

* Open the browser to the Network tab and demonstrate the following:

  * Refresh the page with Command+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Windows) to record the reload.
  
  * 🔑 We examine the status codes of the resources in the Network tab.

  * 🔑 Red status codes indicate errors.

    * Mention that after debugging, the `script.js` file now has a status code of 200.

* Open `12-Stu_Network_Activity/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We can see that the `src` URL was originally incorrect, as shown in the following example:

    ```html
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
    ```

  * If we change the `src` to the correct relative path, it works&mdash;as shown in the following example:

    ```html
    <script src="./assets/js/script.js"></script>
    ```

  * 🔑 After correcting the error we can go back to the Network tab to check whether the corrections work.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we find out if something went wrong with the resources in the Network tab?

  * 🙋 By checking the status code for each resource.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Google documentation on inspecting network activity](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: fetch() Status (5 min)

* Open `13-Ins_Fetch_Status/index.html` in the browser to the Network tab and demonstrate the following:

  * Press Command+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Windows) to record the reload.

  * 🔑 The status for the `fetch()` request is listed with the value of 200.

  * 🔑 This confirms that the `fetch()` request is successful.

* Open `13-Ins_Fetch_Status/asset/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We check whether the `response.status` equals 200, as follows:
  
    ```js
      .then(function (response) {
      if (response.status === 200){
    ```

  * 🔑 If it does, we assign the status code from `response.status` to the `textContent`, like in the following example:

    ```js
    responseText.textContent = response.status;
    ```

  * 🔑 Finally, we return `response.json()`, as follows:

    ```js
    return response.json();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we learn more about using the `Response` object?

  * 🙋 We can read the documentation.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Fetch_Status/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: fetch() Status (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Fetch_Status/README.me`.

  # 🏗️ Implement Status Checking to Display a 404 Message

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to know when the webpage has failed to retrieve data.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when a request is made to an invalid API URL, and the 404 status displays on the page.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  What HTML element can you use to display the response's status code?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * At some point in your coding journey, when working with APIs, you will have to deal with CORS. What is CORS, and how could it interfere with your `fetch()` request?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: fetch() Status (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel using `response.status`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points: 

  * ✔️ `response.status`

  * ✔️ `textContent`

* Open `14-Stu_Fetch_Status/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We check whether the `response.status` does not equal 200, as follows:

    ```js
    .then(function (response) {
      if (response.status !== 200) {
    ```

  * 🔑 We assign the `textContent` to be equal to the `response.status`, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    responseText.textContent = response.status;
    ```

  * 🔑 We still return `response.json()` as `fetch()` will try to resolve the response most of the time, like in the following example:

    ```js
    return response.json();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why are status codes useful?

  * 🙋 Status codes allow us to quickly identify what is causing issues.

  * ☝️ How does this help us as developers?

  * 🙋 By identifying errors quickly, we can debug more efficiently and improve the user experience.

  * ☝️ How do we check whether the `fetch()` request is working properly?

  * 🙋 We check the `response.status`.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Deconstruct Parameters (5 min) 

* Open `15-Ins_Deconstruct_Parameters/index.html` in the browser and navigate to the console, demonstrating the following:

  * 🔑 Sometimes we need to make a specific request to be sure we receive only the information we want.

  * 🔑 We can change requests by chaining parameters onto the endpoints.

  * 🔑 We can find these parameters in the APIs documentation.

* Open `15-Ins_Deconstruct_Parameters/assets/script/js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We attached multiple parameters after `?` in the URL, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    fetch('https://api.github.com/gists/public?since=2020-06-01&per_page=100')
    ```

  * 🔑 Each parameter offers a specific filter. In the following example, `since` filters for a start-from date:

    ```js
    ?since=2020-06-01
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the `&` symbol to chain the parameters together, like in the following example:

    ```js
    ?since=2020-06-01&per_page=100
    ```

  * 🔑 While 30 is the default number of results returned, here we user the `per_page` filter to specify 100, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    &per_page=100
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why is chaining parameters useful?

  * 🙋 It allows us to send a request that will only come back with relevant data, reducing the information that we will have to sort through.

  * ☝️ What are request parameters useful for?

  * 🙋 They enable us to make more specific requests.

  * ☝️ How would we know which parameters we can use in the `fetch()` request?

  * 🙋 By reading the documentation for the API being accessed.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Deconstruct_Parameters/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Deconstruct Parameters (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Deconstruct_Parameters/README.md`.

* Open `16-Stu_Deconstruct_Parameters/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We attached multiple parameters after `?` in the URL, as follows:

    ```js
    fetch('.......?per_page=10&state=open&sort=created&direction=desc')
    ```

  * 🔑 We limit the results to 10 per page, as shown in the following code:
  
    ```js
    per_page=10
    ```

  * 🔑 We chain multiple parameters using the `&` symbol. The first chained parameter is `state`, setting the value to `open`&mdash;which will show us only `open` issues&mdash;as follows:

    ```js
    per_page=10&state=open
    ```

  * 🔑 We `sort` them by their creation date, as shown in the following code:

      ```js
      sort=created
      ```

  * 🔑 We then pass a parameter to display them in descending order, as follows:

    ```js
    fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues?per_page=5')
    ```

  * 🔑 `fetch()` options are passed through as an additional `init` object argument, like in the following example:

    ```js
    fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/node/issues?per_page=5', {
        method: 'GET',
        credentials: 'same-origin',
        redirect: 'follow',
    })
    ```

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Sometimes APIs don't return JSON; they can return other data formats like XML. How can you convert XML to JSON?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: Document Location (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with using the `Location` object? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Checking `response.status`

  * ✔️ Replacing `document.location`

  * ✔️ New `document.location`

* Open `20-Stu__Document_Location/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We set the redirect URL to a variable. This is the URL that the `replace()` method will use, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var redirectUrl = './404.html';
    ```

  * We send the `fetch()` request, as follows:

    ```js
    fetch(badRequestUrl)
    ```

  * 🔑 We check the `response.status` to see whether it equals 404, like in the following example:
  
    ```js
    if (response.status === 404)
    ```
  
  * 🔑 If the `response.status` equals 404, we pass the `redirectURL` variable as an argument into the `document.location.replace` method, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    document.location.replace(redirectUrl);
    ```

  * If the `response.status` does not equal 404, we return `response.json()`, as follows:

    ```js
    else {
        return response.json();
    }
    ```

  * This time we did not return `response.json()` after the `if` statement, because we are changing the `document.location` based on the `response.status`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does the `document.replace` method do? 

  * 🙋 The `document.replace` method replaces the current document with the URL that is passed as an argument.  

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on document.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/location), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
