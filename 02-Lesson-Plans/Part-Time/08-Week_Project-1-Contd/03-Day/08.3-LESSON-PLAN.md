# 08.3 Weekday Lesson Plan: Project 1

## Overview 

In this class, students will present their projects to their peers. 

## Instructor Notes

* Congratulate your class! This is a major milestone in their journey. 

* Project presentations are a rare opportunity for students to practice speaking on technical topics in front of an audience of peers.

* Limit presentations to 10 minutes: 7 or 8 for the presentation itself followed by 2 or 3 minutes for Q & A. This will ensure that every group presents and allow padding for transitions between groups. 

* Prior to class, prepare a list of questions to ask each group to encourage discussion.

* Prior to class, and during presentations if necessary, collaborate with your TAs to prepare a slide deck of superlative "awards" for groups. Refer to [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing).

* In the next module, students will start using Node.js. Advise the students to have Node.js installed before coming to the next class! Direct students to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Demonstrate deployed projects

* Explain the technical implementation of their projects

* Describe their individual roles and contributions to their projects

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (5 min)

* Welcome students to class. 

* Address any last-minute questions before presentations.

### 2. Student Do: Presentations

* Project groups will have 10 minutes to present their project and have a brief Q & A.

* If there aren't many questions, ask the group to explain how they built their application and encourage them to speak technically to some of their code.

* Present superlative 'awards' and congratulate each group for accomplishing this huge milestone!

* In the next class, students will start using Node.js. Remind them to install it prior to class using the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

* Answer any questions before ending class.
