# 12.1 Weekday Lesson Plan: Introduction to MySQL

## Overview

In this lesson, you will introduce students to MySQL Shell and teach them how to execute CRUD functions using SQL commands.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_MySQL-Shell` through `10-Stu_CRUD-DELETE`.

* Make sure that you have installed MySQL on your machine before class, and be prepared to troubleshoot any issues that students might have encountered during setup. For more information, refer to the [MySQL installation page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/).

* Have your MySQL password ready so that you can use MySQL Shell to demonstrate the activities.

**Important**: You will be demonstrating command-line commands that contain your database credentials. Be sure that your MySQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, because it will be visible during the demonstrations.

* Make sure that students can initialize the MySQL Shell using the command `mysql -u root -p`. They will need their MySQL password. Students should also be encouraged to use a MySQL password that is not used for any other personal accounts.

   * If Mac users get a `command not found` error, set up a `.zshrc` file in your home directory and add the `mysql` command to it. To do this, navigate to the home directory and type the following command in the command line: `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`. Mac users who install using Homebrew should not face this issue. Refer to [MySQL Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) for installation instructions.

  * If Windows users get a `command not found` error, refer them to the [MySQL documentation on customizing the PATH](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html).

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Execute commands using the MySQL Shell.

* Create and delete a database.

* Create a table to store data.

* Perform CRUD functions using MySQL commands.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F-uRmcExGF3NYWAh2vz5Nxi8AJe-WWpwpoeAH7rZsOc/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **What is SQL?**

    * **SQL**, or **Structured Query Language**, is a query language that allows us to interact with a database.

  * **How does SQL interact with a database?**

    * SQL uses a **query**, or a structured inquiry, to react with data that is stored in a database. You can use a SQL query to create, read, update, and delete data.

  * **What is a relational database?**

    * A **relational database** organizes data into tables. A table holds a group of data and is divided into rows and columns. The tables can be linked to form relationships.

  * **How do we link tables?**

    * Tables can be linked based on data that is common to both of them. **Keys** identify rows of data in a table. By matching keys between two tables, a relationship is formed.

  * **What does a query do?**

    * A SQL query interacts with data in a database using the names of tables, columns, and relationships between tables. Queries enable us to supply data to the front end to build sites that can interact with lots of data quickly and easily.

  * **Why learn SQL?**

    * SQL is a marketable skill that's used in a majority of databases in every economic sector, from manufacturing, logistics, and health care to insurance, commerce, and much more. SQL also makes it easy to handle large amounts of data and scale up quickly.

* Navigate to `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main` in your command line and start up the MySQL Shell:

  ```sh
  mysql -u root -p
  ```

* Create the database by running the schema and seeds files, then exit the MySQL Shell using the `exit` command:

  ```sh
  SOURCE db/schema.sql;
  SOURCE db/seeds.sql;
  ```

* Add your MySQL password to the `server.js` file and run `npm install` and `node server.js`.

* Open `http://localhost:3001/api/movies` demonstrate the following:

  * We use SQL queries to write and retrieve data from the database.

  * This SQL query returns the `id` and `title` from each row in the movies database.

  * The data is returned as an object that we can then manipulate and use to populate the page.

  * Using a SQL query, we can return even large sets of data quickly.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning to use SQL, or Structured Query Language, to access a database.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will use an Express.js server to send the SQL queries and access the database.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 SQL is used in many industries and is a highly sought-after skill in the development field.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: MySQL Shell (5 min)

* Open the command line. Navigate to `01-Ins_MySQL-Shell` and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 To start, we navigate to the root directory of the project and then type the following command into the terminal to confirm that the MySQL server is up and running:

    ```sh
    mysql --version
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, in the terminal, at the root directory of the project, we enter the following command and enter the MySQL password when prompted:

    ```sh
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

  * 🔑 We write each command after the `mysql` prompt. Don't forget, all commands must end with a semicolon!

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE demo_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also write the commands in a SQL file and execute the file in MySQL Shell using `source`:

    ```sql
    source schema.sql
    ```

  * 🔑 To exit MySQL Shell, we type `quit`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are two ways that we can execute commands using MySQL Shell?

  * 🙋 We can enter the command after the `mysql` prompt, or we can write the command in a SQL file and then execute the the file using `source`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_MySQL-Shell/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: MySQL Shell (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_MySQL-Shell/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md

  ## 💡 Hints

  Which commands do you use to start MySQL in the command line?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What kind of database is MySQL?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: MySQL Shell (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with MySQL Shell? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `schema.sql`

  * ✔️ `SOURCE`

* Navigate to `02-Stu_MySQL-Shell/Solved` in your command line and explain the following:

  * To open the MySQL Shell, we execute `mysql -u root -p` in the command line and then enter the MySQL password:

    ```sh
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

  * 🔑 We then use the `SOURCE` command to execute the schema from the `schema.sql` shell. Don't forget the semicolon!

    ```sh
    SOURCE schema.sql;
    ```

  * 🔑 We use the `SHOW` command to display the existing databases and confirm that the new database has been created:

    ```sh
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

  * To exit MySQL Shell, we enter the command `quit`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we execute a schema file in MySQL Shell?

  * 🙋 To execute a `schema.sql` file in MySQL Shell, we use the `SOURCE` command.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL documentation on getting started with MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-getting-started.html), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Databases (5 min)

* Open `03-Ins_Databases` in your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use a database to store and organize data that we will access with MySQL.

  * 🔑 To create a new database, first we navigate to the command line and enter `mysql -u root -p` to open MySQL Shell:

    ```sh
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we use the `CREATE DATABASE` command and add the database that we want to create:

      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
      ```

  * 🔑 The `CREATE` command is all we really need, but it is a good idea to check whether the database has already been created, and drop it if so. We do this before we create the database:

      ```sql
      DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS inventory_db;
      CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
      ```

  * 🔑 Once a database is created, we enter `USE` to select the database:

      ```sql
      USE inventory_db;
      ```

  * 🔑 We also check which database is currently in use:

      ```sql
      SELECT DATABASE();
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we create and select a database using MySQL?

  * 🙋 We use the `CREATE` command to create a database and the `USE` command to select a database.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Databases/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Databases (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Databases/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📖 Use MySQL Statements to Delete, Create, and Select a Database

  * As a developer, I want to create a new database and select that database for use.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when `sample_db` is dropped and no longer appears on the list of all databases.

  * It's done when a new `books_db` database is created and selected for use.

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [MySQL documentation on creating and selecting a database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-database.html)

  [MySQL documentation on DROP DATABASE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-database.html)

  ## 💡 Hints

  Which statement can we use to show all databases?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * SQL is a **relational database management system**, or **RDBMS**. What are the characteristics of an RDBMS? What other database systems fall into the category of RDBMS?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Databases (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with databases? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `DROP DATABASE`

  * ✔️ `CREATE DATABASE`

  * ✔️ `USE`

* Open `04-Stu_Databases/Solved/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * To drop and create a database, we can either enter the commands directly into MySQL Shell or use a file.

  * 🔑 To drop the `sample_db` database, we use the `DROP` command:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sample_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 To create a new `books_db` database, we start by checking whether a database of the same name already exists -- and if so, we drop it:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we add a new `books_db` database using the `CREATE` command:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE books_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 To select the `books_db` database, we use the `USE` command:

    ```sql
    USE books_db;
    ```

* Navigate to `04-Stu_Databases/Solved` in your command line and enter `mysql -u root -p` to open MySQL Shell.

  * We execute the schema file in the MySQL Shell using `SOURCE`:

    ```sql
    SOURCE schema.sql;
    ```

  * To check that the `books_db` database is in use, we use `SELECT DATABASE()`:

    ```sql
    SELECT DATABASE();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Which command do we use to delete a database?

  * 🙋 We use the `DROP DATABASE` command. To prevent an error from occurring if the database does not exist, we add `IF EXISTS`.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL documentation on CREATE DATABASE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-database.html) and the [MySQL documentation on DROP DATABASE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-database.html), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Tables (5 min)

* Open `05-Ins_Tables/db/schema.sql` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 To add data to databases, we use tables.

  * 🔑 We start by creating a database to hold the tables:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS inventory_db;
    CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we select the database where we plan to add the tables:

    ```sql
    USE inventory_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 To create a new table, we use the `CREATE TABLE` command, followed by the name of the new table:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE produce;
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, in parentheses `()`, we add the names of the columns that will hold the data and describe the type of data that the column will hold. We designate an integer using `INT` and specify a string of up to 100 characters using `VARCHAR(100)`:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE produce (
      id INT,
      name VARCHAR(100)
    );
    ```

* Navigate to `05-Ins_Tables/db` in your command line and enter `mysql -u root -p` to open MySQL Shell.

  * We execute the schema file using the `SOURCE` command:

    ```sql
    SOURCE schema.sql;
    ```

  * We use the `SHOW` command to list the tables in the database and check that the table has been successfully added:

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we add data to the database?

  * 🙋 We create a table to hold the data. Tables are composed of columns, which hold types of data like integers or strings.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Tables/README.md`.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Tables (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with tables? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `CREATE TABLE`

  * ✔️ `SHOW TABLES`

* Open `06-Stu_Tables/Solved/db/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Tables store data in databases. To start, we create a database to hold the new table:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    CREATE DATABASE books_db;
    ```

  * Then, to select the new database, we enter the `USE` command:

    ```sql
    USE books_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, we use the `CREATE` command to give the table a name:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE biographies;
    ```

  * Tables are composed of columns that hold a certain data type. We add two columns, `int` and `name`, and add their data types:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE biographies (
      id INT,
      name VARCHAR(100)
    );
    ```

* Navigate to `06-Stu_Tables/Solved/db` in your command line and enter `mysql -u root -p` to open MySQL Shell.

  * We execute the file using `SOURCE`:

    ```sql
    SOURCE schema.sql;
    ```

  * We check that the database was created, using `SHOW DATABASES;`:

    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

  * 🔑 We check that the new table is part of the database, using `SHOW TABLES;`:

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we create a table to store data inside a database?

  * 🙋 We select the database using the `USE` command. Then we use the `CREATE TABLE` command to create a table.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL documentation on creating a table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-tables.html), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: CRUD Insert (5 min)

* Open `07-Ins_CRUD-Insert/db/insert-one.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * In a MySQL table, data is stored in rows. To add a row to an existing table, we use the `INSERT INTO` command, followed by the name of the table where we want to add data:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO produce
    ```

  * The data must fit into the existing columns. So we specify the columns where we want to add data:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO produce (id, name)
    ```

  * We then add data for the row -- making sure that the data matches the assigned data type -- using `VALUES`:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO produce (id, name)
      VALUES (1, "apple");
    ```

* Open `07-Ins_CRUD-Insert/db/insert-many.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We can also add data to multiple rows at the same time, making sure that we separate each row of data with a comma (`,`):

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO produce (id, name)
      VALUES
       ( 1, "apple"),
       ( 2, "orange"),
       ( 3, "banana");
    ```

* Navigate to `07-Ins_CRUD-Insert/db` in your command line and enter `mysql -u root -p` to open MySQL Shell.

  * We execute the `schema.sql` file in MySQL Shell to create the database and table:

    ```sql
    SOURCE schema.sql;
    ```

  * We use `SELECT DATABASE()` to check that the database is now in use and that the table has been added. This is the table where we will add the data:

    ```sql
    SELECT DATABASE();
    ```

  * We execute the `insert-many.sql` file in the shell to add multiple rows of data:

    ```sql
    SOURCE insert-many.sql;
    ```

  * Now that we have stored data in the table, we can access and manipulate it with a query. We use the `SELECT` command to select data -- and an asterisk (`*`) to select all the data in each row:

    ```sql
    SELECT * from produce;
    ```

  * The data from each row is returned in the command line.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we add data to a table?

  * 🙋 We use the `INSERT INTO` command.

  * ☝️ How do write a query to select all the data in a table?

  * 🙋 We use the `SELECT` command. To select all, we can use an asterisk.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_CRUD-Insert/README.md`.

### 13. Student Do: CRUD Insert (15 min)

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel adding data to a table and selecting the data? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `INSERT INTO`

  * ✔️ `VALUES`

  * ✔️ `SELECT *`

* Open `08-Stu_CRUD-Insert/Solved/db/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We check whether a database named `books_db` already exists, and if so, we drop it:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    ```

  * We create a new database using `CREATE DATABASE`:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE books_db;
    ```

  * We select the new database with `USE`:

    ```sql
    USE books_db;
    ```

  * We create a new table, `biographies`, with two columns: `id` and `name`. Each column is assigned a data type that determines the kind of information it will hold:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE biographies (
      id INT NOT NULL,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

* Open `08-Stu_CRUD-Insert/Solved/db/insert-select.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 Now that we have created a database and a table to hold data, we can insert the data. We use the `INSERT INTO` command to select the table and the columns where we want to add data:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO biographies (id, name)
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, we use `VALUES` to add values:

    ```sql
    VALUES
      ( 001, "Diary of Anne Frank"),
      ( 002, "Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo"),
      ( 003, "Long Walk to Freedom");
    ```

  * To query the database and select all the data from the new table, we use `SELECT *`:

     ```sql
     SELECT * from biographies;
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we insert data into a table?

  * 🙋 We first have to select the database where the table is located. Then we use the `INSERT INTO` command to select the table and columns where we want to add data. Finally, we use the `VALUES` command to add new rows of data.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL documentation on INSERT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: CRUD Delete (5 min)

* Open `09-Ins_CRUD-Delete/db/delete.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We can delete a row in a table by first using the `DELETE FROM` command to select a table:

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM produce
    ```

  * 🔑 Because we do not want to delete all the rows, we use the `WHERE` clause to specify a condition for the row. In this case, we want to delete the row where `id` equals `2`:

    ```sql
    WHERE id = 2;
    ```

* Open `09-Ins_CRUD-Delete/db/update.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We can also use the `UPDATE` command to change the data. To start, we select the table that we want to update:

    ```sql
    UPDATE produce
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we use `SET` to assign the new data to a column:

    ```sql
    SET name = "strawberry"
    ```

  * 🔑 We only want the `name` column to have the value of `strawberry` in the row where the `id` is `1`, so we add a `WHERE` clause:

    ```sql
    WHERE id = 1;
    ```

* Navigate to `09-Ins_CRUD-Delete/db` in your command line and enter `mysql -u root -p` to open MySQL Shell.

  * We execute the `schema.sql` file in MySQL Shell to create the database and table:

    ```sql
    SOURCE schema.sql;
    ```

  * We use `SELECT *` to display the contents of the `produce` table:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM produce;
    ```

  * We execute the `delete.sql` file to run the delete query:

    ```sql
    SOURCE delete.sql;
    ```

  * When we run a `SELECT` query to display the contents of the `produce` table again, we find that the row has been deleted:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM produce;
    ```

  * We execute the `update.sql` file to run the update query:

    ```sql
    SOURCE update.sql;
    ```

  * When we run a `SELECT` query to display the contents of the `produce` table again, we find that the data for row `2` has changed:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM produce;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Which clause do we use to specify a condition?

  * 🙋 We use the `WHERE` clause to specify a condition. For example, if we set the condition to `id = 2`, then only the row with the `id` of `2` will be deleted or updated.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/README.md`.

### 16. Student Do: CRUD Delete (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  # 🐛 Data Not Updating in Database

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

  * As a user, I want to update a single row of data in a table using a MySQL statement.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When I execute a MySQL statement, I want only the data with an `id` of `2` to update to `Candide`.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When I execute a MySQL statement to update the data, the data in every row displays the new value.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. Create a `books_db` database and select it for use.

  2. Execute the `insert.sql` file in the command line to insert data.

  3. Execute the `update.sql` file to update the table.

  4. Enter the query `SELECT * FROM fiction` to view the contents of the table.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The table lists three data entries, with "Candide" appearing in row 2.](./assets/image-1.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  What clause do we use to filter and select specific rows to be updated?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How do we distinguish SQL syntax from other text?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: CRUD Delete (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel deleting and updating data? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `UPDATE`

  * ✔️ `SET`

  * ✔️ `WHERE`

* Open `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/Solved/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We create a `books_db` database and select it for use:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    CREATE DATABASE books_db;
    USE books_db;
    ```

  * We create a table named `fiction` to hold the data. The table has an `id` column and a `name` column:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE fiction (
      id INT NOT NULL,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

* Open `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/Solved/insert.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We use `INSERT INTO` to add data:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO fiction (id, name)
      VALUES
       ( 001, "To Kill a Mockingbird"),
       ( 002, "100 Years of Solitude"),
       ( 003, "War and Peace");
    ```

* Open `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/Solved/update.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Now that we have data in the table, we use the `UPDATE` command to update the data in the `fiction` table:

    ```sql
    UPDATE fiction
    ```

  * Then we use `SET` to determine the column where the data will be updated:

    ```sql
    SET name = "Candide"
    ```

  * Next, we add a condition to determine which rows will be changed. If we don't set a condition, all the rows will be changed:

    ```sql
    WHERE id = 2;
    ```

* Navigate to `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/Solved` in your command line and enter `mysql -u root -p` to open MySQL Shell.

  * We execute the `schema.sql` file in the MySQL Shell to create the database along with the table. We then execute the `insert.sql` file to add data:

    ```sql
    SOURCE schema.sql;
    SOURCE insert.sql;
    ```

  * We use `SELECT *` to display the contents of the `fiction` table:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM fiction;
    ```

  * Now that we have specified a condition using a `WHERE` clause, only the second row has changed!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Which CRUD operations can we perform using a SQL query?

  * 🙋 We can create data using `INSERT`, read data using `SELECT`, update data using `UPDATE`, and delete data using `DELETE`.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL documentation on examples of common queries](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/examples.html), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
