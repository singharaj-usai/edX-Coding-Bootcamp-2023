# Module 12 Instructor Overview: SQL

## Overview

This week, youâ€™ll introduce students to a final layer of the tech stack: the database. You will teach students how to design a MySQL database that can store large amounts of data, as well as introduce them to the tools to create, read, update, and delete data. You will also cover connecting a MySQL database to a Node.js application using an Express.js server.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's Challenge.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Make sure that you have installed MySQL on your machine before class, and be prepared to troubleshoot any issues that students might have encountered during setup. For more information, refer to the [MySQL installation page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/).

* Have your MySQL password ready so that you can use MySQL Shell to demonstrate the activities.

* Make sure that students can initialize the MySQL command-line prompt using the command `mysql -u root -p`. They will need their MySQL password.

   * If Mac users get a `command not found` error, set up a `.zshrc` file in your home directory and add the `mysql` command to it. To do this, navigate to the home directory and type the following command in the command line: `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`. Mac users who install using Homebrew should not face this issue. Refer to [MySQL Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) for installation instructions.

  * If Windows users get a `command not found` error, refer them to the [MySQL documentation on customizing the PATH](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html).

* For the Challenge this week, students will use MySQL, Node.js, and Inquirer to build a command-line application. For a refresher, refer students to the [npm documentation on Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

During the next module, students will learn to use [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify their MySQL queries and easily handle data in a full-stack app.
