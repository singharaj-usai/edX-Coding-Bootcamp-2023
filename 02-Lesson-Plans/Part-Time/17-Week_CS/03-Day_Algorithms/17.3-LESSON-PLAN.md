# 17.3 Weekday Lesson Plan: Algorithms, Recursion, and the Technical Interview

## Overview

Today's lesson diverges from the JavaScript-specific topics of the previous lessons and introduces students to algorithms that they're likely to encounter during a technical interview. This class covers search algorithms, recursion, and a mock-interview practice with sorting algorithms.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Linear-Search` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be sure to review the activities before class and try to anticipate any questions that students might have.

* Because [Big O notation](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) is difficult to explain in an activity, spend some time at the beginning of class and after each algorithm review to help students visualize the differences in time complexities and performance.

* The mini-project this week will not be in a typical group project setting, but rather in smaller groups of 2&ndash3 students. Students will simulate a technical interview, with one student assuming the role of the interviewer and the other assuming the role of the candidate. If students struggle to adjust to the new format, emphasize that practicing interviews will help them clarify and organize their thoughts so that they are more prepared for a real interview. They should also revisit this on their own time because additional practice will make them more prepared and comfortable with the process. Try to share a personal anecdote of the interview process if possible.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo and to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Shell` activity, walk them through it using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and briefly review it at the end. They might not be able to finish, and that's okay!

* Remind students to have MongoDB installed before coming to the next class! Direct students to the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a linear search algorithm.

* Use recursion to solve a Fibonacci sequence algorithm.

* Implement a binary search algorithm and know when to use it over a linear search algorithm.

* Write shell scripts to be executed from the command line.

* Articulate and implement sorting algorithms in a technical interview setting.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Explain that even though most of us will apply for JavaScript-related jobs, technical interviews typically also assess our knowledge of a few general computer science topics.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ In computing, what is an algorithm?

  * 🙋 An algorithm is a self-contained series of steps that describes a way to solve a problem for a human or machine.

  * ☝️ Are algorithms the same thing as functions?

  * 🙋 No, an algorithm is an abstracted idea of how to solve a problem, whereas a function is a means of implementing the steps outlined by the algorithm.

  * ☝️ Why is it important for a full-stack JavaScript developer to understand and articulate how to implement popular computer science algorithms?

  * 🙋 Understanding algorithms helps developers think about a problem in a conceptual and abstracted way, allowing them to come to a better and more efficient solution&mdash;ultimately making them better developers!

  * ☝️ Do we think some algorithms can solve problems more quickly than others?

  * 🙋 Yes, and it usually depends on the type of problem being solved. That's why it's important for us to know how different types of algorithms work in different situations.

* Open [the Big-O Cheat Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) and explain the following while walking through the chart:

  * 🔑 In computer science, we measure an algorithm's efficiency by finding the potential amount of steps it will take to solve a problem in a worst-case scenario in relation to the size of the data it's being performed on.

  * 🔑 This is what's known as the **Big-O complexity** of an algorithm. It's how we can identify which algorithms will work better given a specific problem that needs solving.

* Explain that today we will learn about popular algorithms, how to implement them, and how to go about solving questions about them in a technical interview.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Linear Search (5 min)

* Open the [Searching Sorted List Visualizer](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html) in your browser, perform a linear search function, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We can search for where an element appears in an array by checking each value one at a time.

  * 🔑 When we find that element, we return the index of where it appeared and then stop the function.

  * 🔑 If we don't find the element we're looking for, we receive a `-1` back because there is no `-1` index in a JavaScript array.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we approach this?

  * 🙋 We need to pseudocode it!

* Open `21-Ins_Linear-Search/linear-search.md` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 During a technical interview, it's always a good idea to spend some time pseudocoding and laying out your thought process before writing code.

  * 🔑 For a linear search algorithm implementation using JavaScript, this is what those steps might look like, but they may vary depending on the person implementing it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What assumptions can we make about this algorithm's implementation?

  * 🙋 We can assume that the input array will be an array of numbers and that it has at least one element in it.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Linear-Search/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Linear Search (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Linear-Search/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement a Linear Search Algorithm

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to find the position of a value in a set of data.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the search algorithm function can accept an input array and value to find.

  * It's done when the search algorithm returns the position of the value we are searching for.

  * It's done when the search algorithm returns `-1` to indicate that the value is not in the data set.

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can we run the unit tests to test our algorithm?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is a more efficient search algorithm?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Linear Search (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with the linear search algorithm? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Array and element inputs

  * ✔️ Return the index

  * ✔️ Big O(n) complexity

* Open `22-Stu_Linear-Search/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We create a function that accepts the array we're searching in and the element we're searching the array for:

    ```js
    const linearSearch = (array, element) => {};
    ```

  * 🔑 We iterate through the array and check every single element if it matches the one we're searching for and return the index of the matched element:

    ```js
    // Loop the given array.
    for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
      // Check to see if the index of the given array is equal to the element we are searching for.
      if (array[index] === element) {
        // Exit the search by returning the index of the element.
        return index;
      }
    }
    ```

  * If we don't find a match, the `for` loop ends and we return `-1` to indicate it isn't in this array.

  * 🔑 Because the worse case scenario of this algorithm is that the loop takes us all the way through the array, its complexity grows at a 1:1 rate with how big the input array is, giving it a Big O complexity of `O(n)`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are some good features of this algorithm?

  * 🙋 It will work on unsorted arrays and has a predictable level of complexity.

  * ☝️ What may be a drawback of this algorithm?

  * 🙋 If we have a very large array to search through, the Big O complexity `O(n)` can become inefficient.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read more about search algorithms, and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Recursion (5 min)

* Navigate to `23-Ins_Recursion` from the command line, run `node index.js` and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we run this file, we get a number countdown printed on the page.

  * 🔑 We could do this with a loop, but we didn't.

* Navigate to `23-Ins_Recursion/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following

  * 🔑 Instead of a loop, we use a recursive function to call itself over and over again until we meet the exit condition we've defined ourselves.

  * 🔑 If we didn't have this condition in place, known as a "base" or "exit" condition, our program would loop indefinitely and cause our program to crash.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are some use cases for using recursion over loops?

  * 🙋 Recursion allows us to control when the next iteration happens and is very useful for when we don't exactly know how many times we need the functionality to run.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Recursion/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Recursion (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Recursion/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of a Fibonacci Sequence Algorithm

  Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved).

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation:

  [Math Is Fun: The Fibonacci Sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/Fibonacci-sequence.html)

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * In programming, what is a stack overflow?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Recursion (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with recursion? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ We search by position

  * ✔️ No recursion for 0 or 1 positions

  * ✔️ Value is the sum of previous values

* Open `24-Stu_Recursion/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 The function returns the value of a given position in the Fibonacci sequence:

    ```js
    const Fibonacci = (position) => {}
    ```

    * 🔑 If the input position is less than `2`, we can assume that the position will be `0` or `1`, which are the actual values of the Fibonacci sequence at that position:

      ```js
      if (position < 2) {
        return position;
      }
      ```

  * 🔑 We get a value of the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two position values in the sequence, so we need to calculate their values with the same function, which will call it again and again until `position` is under `2`:

    ```js
    return Fibonacci(position - 1) + Fibonacci(position - 2);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we visualize this algorithm? Is there a specific data structure we can use to model it?

  * 🙋 We can visualize it as a binary tree data structure, with each node spawning two nodes below it, which then spawn two nodes below them, and so on.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read about the [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/Fibonacci-sequence.html) and the [MDN docs on recursive functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#Recursion), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Binary Search (5 min)

* Open the [Searching Sorted List visualizer](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html) in your browser, perform a binary search, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Unlike the linear search, a binary search works by checking one value at a time starting in the middle of the data set.

  * 🔑 We identify if the value we're searching for is greater or less than the middle value and cut out half of the data set when we know the value is in the other half.

  * 🔑 If we don't find the element we're looking for, we receive a `-1` back, because there is no `-1` index in a JavaScript array.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to pseudocode it!

* Open `25-Ins_Binary-Search/binary-search.md` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 During a technical interview, it's always a good idea to spend some time pseudocoding and laying out your thought process before writing code.

  * 🔑 For a binary search algorithm implementation using JavaScript, this is what those steps might look like, but may have more or less depending on the person implementing it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What assumptions can we make about this algorithm's implementation?

  * 🙋 We can assume that the input array must be sorted for it to work.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Binary-Search/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Binary Search (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Binary-Search/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🐛 Binary Search Algorithm Not Passing Tests

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to find the position of a value in a data set by using a binary search function.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When we run unit tests to test the binary search function, the defined tests pass.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When we run unit tests to test the binary search function, the defined tests do not pass.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. In the command line, from the [Unsolved](./Unsolved) directory, run `npm install`.

  2. Run `npm run test` to run the unit tests.

  3. The tests defined in the `__tests__` directory do not pass.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can the unit test descriptions help us determine what the function is or is not doing?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is worst possible Big-O complexity that an algorithm can have? What is the best?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (10 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Binary Search (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with a binary search algorithm? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Adjust start and end positions

  * ✔️ The `while` loop

  * ✔️ Exit conditions

* Open `26-Stu_Binary-Search` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We start by getting the start and end positions, which we will update when we determine what half our value lies in:

    ```js
    let start = 0;
    let end = array.length - 1;
    ```

  * 🔑 We use a `while` loop to continuously run the functionality of getting a middle value, checking if the searched value is greater than, less than, or equal to it, and adjusting the start and end points if we need to:

    ```js
    while (start <= end) {
      let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);

      if (array[mid] === element) {
        // We must return true once we have found the element being searched for.
        return true;
      } else if (array[mid] < element) {
        start = mid + 1;
      } else {
        end = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We are done running this function when either the middle value is the value we're searching for or we've cut the search array down so much that the end value becomes less than the start value and the `while` loop ends to return `false`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the Big O complexity of this algorithm?

  * 🙋 It has a Big O complexity of `O(log n)` because it effectively cuts its input in half every pass.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Wikipedia entry on binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Shell/README.md`.

### 12. Everyone Do: Shell Scripts (10 min)

* Open your command line environment and demonstrate the following:

  * We've been using this environment throughout the class to perform a number of functions for our computer, Node.js applications, and Git repositories.

  * This is because our command line is powered by what's known as a "shell," which has a programming language of its own that we can use to help perform complex tasks and provide automation in our workflow.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Shell/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Open `27-Evr_Shell/Solved/git-file-cleanup.sh` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 In order to write our own commands to be executed as programs across our computers, we must begin the file with a shebang interpreter directive:

    ```sh
    #!/bin/bash
    ```

  * 🔑 We can store commands in variables and recall them whenever we want, such as a Git command to be executed from our program:

    ```sh
    TO_REMOVE=`git clean -f -d -n`;
    ```

  * A lot of Git commands that affect the repository have what's known as a "dry run" `-n` option to show what would happen without actually doing it.

  * 🔑 These commands can be set up for execution anywhere in our `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` files as "aliases":

    ```sh
    # in a run command file...
    alias gfc="~/git-file-cleanup.sh"
    ```

  * Congratulate students on taking a moment to quickly learn a new programming language!

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project (5 min)

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 Technical interviews are intimidating for even the most experienced developers, so it's good to practice either with others or on your own to build confidence.

  * 🔑 The questions asked during an interview are sometimes purposefully ambiguous and will require the candidate to follow up with some questions or assumptions. This gives the interviewer an idea of how the candidate approaches problems, even if they do not know the solution.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What happens if we don't know the answer to a question asked?

  * 🙋 During an interview, be honest about it and talk your way through it anyway, asking questions as needed. In this environment, work together to come to a solution.

* Answer any questions before inviting students to start the mini-project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (45 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Module 17 Mini-Project: Technical Interview Practice (Sorting Algorithms)

  In this mini-project, you and a partner will simulate a technical interview by taking turns as the interviewer and job candidate.

  ## Roles

  * **The Interviewer**: The role of the interviewer is to pose the question, ensure the candidate understands what is expected of them as they work towards a solution, and respond to any questions the candidate has without giving away the answer.

  * **The Candidate**: The role of the candidate is to ensure that the problem stated by the interviewer is clear by asking clarifying questions and stating assumptions, pseudocoding a solution, and then implementing it (if time allows).

  ## Instructions

  * Take turns playing each role and go through each interview question.

  * Spend about 20 minutes on each, allowing time for research of the problem, pseudocoding the solution, implementing the solution, and discussing throughout for clarification.

  * The interviewer can use the prompts and solutions laid out for each question in the [Main](./Main) directory.

  * The candidate can use the prompts, notes, and workspace for each question in the [Develop](./Develop) directory.

  * During each question, allow the candidate to do some research on the question using Google to help outline a solution. The interviewer can spend that time reviewing the solution code and come up with prompts to support the candidate.

  * Take this seriously, but don't put too much pressure on yourself to get to an answer! The idea is to be conversational about these questions to help both of you come to a solution that you can understand and explain in an interview setting.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Sorting algorithms

  * ✔️ The role of the interviewer

  * ✔️ The role of the candidate

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/01_bubble-sort/bubble-sort.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 A bubble sort function can be implemented in a couple of ways. One way involves sorting the array one index at a time, the other will iterate the entire array multiple times and sort elements gradually until it doesn't need to sort anymore. The second way is slightly more efficient because we build in a base condition to end early if the array is sorted:

    ```js
    while (!sorted) {
      sorted = true;
      for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] > array[i + 1]) {
          const tmp = array[i];
          array[i] = array[i + 1];
          array[i + 1] = tmp;
          sorted = false;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 The interviewer will likely want the candidate to be able to articulate the differences between the two implementations and why one might be more efficient than the other.

  * 🔑 The candidate should be able to articulate the need for a temporary variable to hold an element being swapped and how a flag can be set to determine if the array has been sorted yet or not.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/02_quick-sort/quick-sort.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 A quick sort algorithm works by recursively splitting an array in two based on greater than or less than values compared to a pivot element until there are numerous arrays in order that can be concatenated back together and returned in a sorted fashion:

    ```js
    const quickSort = (array) => {
      if (array.length <= 1) {
        return array;
      }
      const pivot = array.splice(Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length), 1);
      const left = [];
      const right = [];

      array.forEach((el) => {
        if (el <= pivot) {
          left.push(el);
        } else {
          right.push(el);
        }
      });
      return quickSort(left).concat(pivot, quickSort(right));
    };

  * 🔑 The interviewer might ask this question to see if the candidate has a good understanding of recursion.

  * 🔑 The candidate should be able to visualize the recursive nature of this type of algorithm and be able to explain why the selection of a random pivot point works for this type of algorithm.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/03_merge-sort/merge-sort.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 A merge sort algorithm involves using recursion to continuously break apart an array until we're left with a series of single-element arrays:

    ```js
    const mergeSort = (array) => {
      if (array.length <= 1) {
        return array;
      }
      const middle = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
      const left = array.slice(0, middle);
      const right = array.slice(middle);
      return mergeArrays(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
    };
    ```

  * All of these arrays are then compared to one another and used to build a new array that's sorted and eventually returned:

    ```js
    const mergeArrays = (leftArray, rightArray) => {
      const resultArray = [];
      let leftIndex = 0;
      let rightIndex = 0;

      while (leftIndex < leftArray.length && rightIndex < rightArray.length) {
        if (leftArray[leftIndex] < rightArray[rightIndex]) {
          resultArray.push(leftArray[leftIndex]);
          leftIndex++;
        } else {
          resultArray.push(rightArray[rightIndex]);
          rightIndex++;
        }
      }

      return resultArray
        .concat(leftArray.slice(leftIndex))
        .concat(rightArray.slice(rightIndex));
    };
    ```

  * 🔑 This is a difficult interview question, so the interviewer might ask this when they are confident in the previous answers a candidate has provided. Because it's a bit longer to implement in code, the interviewer will likely want to ensure that the candidate can accurately describe a solution in pseudocode first so that time isn't lost.

  * 🔑 The candidate should be able to again visualize the recursive nature of this algorithm and explain that rather than trying to sort a large set of data, we break our data into smaller sets and iteratively sort them back together.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we prepare ourselves for questions like this during an interview?

  * 🙋 We can practice and not be discouraged if we can't always get to an answer!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, undertake more interview practice among ourselves, and stay for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (5 min)

* Open `02-Challenge/README.md` in your browser and explain the following:

  * Sometimes the best way to learn or fully understand a topic is to challenge yourself with teaching it to others. Web developers often do this by writing tutorials and blog posts.

  * In this Challenge, you will write a tutorial that explains the components that go into a specific regular expression, or regex.

  * You will have to do some research on regex in order to properly write your tutorial.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning regex by writing a tutorial about it.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 The more knowledge we have about certain tools and algorithms, the more effective we will be as developers.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 Regex is a powerful tool that we can implement, just like an algorithm. Knowledge about it will make us more confident in our skills both on the job and during a technical interview.

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Challenge Requirements found in `02-Challenge/README.md`.

* In the next class, students will start using MongoDB. Remind them to install it prior to class using the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb).

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
