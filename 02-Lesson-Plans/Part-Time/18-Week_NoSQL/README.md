# Module 18 Instructor Overview: NoSQL

## Overview

In this module, you will introduce students to NoSQL databases and performing CRUD operations using MongoDB, a popular NoSQL document-based database. Students will also learn how to use Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, to enforce a specific schema on data and handle data relationships. Deployment of an application using Mongo Atlas and Heroku is also discussed.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's Challenge.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Be sure to have MongoDB and Compass installed on your machine before the first class. Refer to the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) for instructions.

* Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. To use, make sure that you first have both MongoDB and Node.js installed. For start-up instructions, refer to the [Mongoose docs on getting started](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html).

* Mongo Atlas, a fully managed cloud database, will be used to deploy the Mini-Project to Heroku. For instructions on how to sign up for an account and deploy a free cluster, refer to [Get started free with MongoDB Atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/).

* This module's activities do not have a front end and all routes will be tested using Insomnia. Please make sure that you have Insomnia installed locally prior to class. Refer to [Insomnia installation docs](https://insomnia.rest/download) as needed.

* Though MongoDB might be new to most learners, today's activities build on skills developed in earlier modules, including Express servers, SQL databases, data relationships, and queries. Where possible, encourage students to make connections to prior learning and start thinking about the role that databases such as MongoDB play in their apps.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

## Heads-Up

In Module 19, students will learn about measuring and optimizing the performance of web applications, as well as learning how to create Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). Chrome Devtools and Google Lighthouse will be our primary tools for measuring web application performance. We will use the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses, which ensures that the application will continue to work without an internet connection. To unlock the power of service workers, we will use `webpack` and Workbox.

This module is a precursor to the upcoming React modules, because webpack is an important part of React. While learning about PWAs, students will gain exposure to the client-server architecture, which is different from the MVC model that they had been using in previous weeks.
