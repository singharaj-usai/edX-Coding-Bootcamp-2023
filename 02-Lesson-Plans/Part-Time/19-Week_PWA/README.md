# Module 19 Instructor Overview: Progressive Web Applications (PWA)

## Overview

In this module, students will learn about Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) and the tools used to create them. Some of these tools&mdash;such as webpack, service workers, and IndexedDB&mdash;are not exclusive to PWAs. They are just a few of the many pieces that make up the PWA framework. Tools like webpack and workbox can optimize and boost the performance of web applications so that more users can comfortably use a web application.

This module is a precursor to the upcoming React module, because webpack is an important part of React. While learning about PWAs, students will gain exposure to the client-server architecture, which is different from the MVC model that they had been using in previous weeks.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's Challenge.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* On Day 2 and Day 3, make sure you work in an incognito window for each activity to avoid caching issues. It would be a good idea to have students do the same.

* Take some time to refresh your memory on how the Service Worker API works. For the service worker activities, you will have to use offline mode, which is in the Application tab under the Service Worker section in Chrome DevTools. You may have to clear your service workers for `localhost` in the Chrome settings.

* On Day 3, students learn about the `manifest.json` file, so it would be a good idea to review how this file works as well as its purpose.

* The Challenge uses the Codemirror library, but students should not have to edit that file in any way to complete the Challenge.

* PWAs can be frustrating at times, so try to be understanding if a student is having trouble grasping it.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

* In the next module, students will get their first introduction to React. This is a huge step for them, so give students a lot of encouragement.

* Make sure that you are familiar with components, state, and hooks before starting the lesson.

* We are getting to the end of the boot camp and students are probably starting to feel the fatigue. Try to keep the morale high!
