# Module 23 Instructor Overview: Project 3

## Overview

In this module, students will begin work on their final projects. These projects are student-driven; they will be responsible for forming their own teams, brainstorming app ideas, and developing a full-stack MERN app. The final project of the Boot Camp will be a full-stack MERN application.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's group project.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* For the final project, students will be choosing their own groups. Let students know that they should contact the instructor or TAs when they have decided on their groups for approval. Please be flexible and empathetic in addressing student concerns regarding groups, or the lack of members to team up with.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

* Students can also use this time to work on their portfolios.

* Encourage students to spend time pseudocoding their projects and researching APIs and libraries before writing any code.

## Career Connection

## Heads-Up

* Students will present their projects at the end of the next module. Emphasize that students should focus on deploying a lean MVP, and then add features with any time they have left.

* Let students know that they can also use this time to work on their portfolios.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group next week. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlPJhHnHvLLtKheKl4opm7tibkjjALZeAzwVvZdJDO0/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.
