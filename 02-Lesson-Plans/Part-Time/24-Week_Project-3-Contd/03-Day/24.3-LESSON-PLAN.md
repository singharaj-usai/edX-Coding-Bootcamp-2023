# 24.3 Weekday Lesson Plan: Project Presentations

## Overview

In this class, students will present their projects to their peers.

## Instructor Notes

* Congratulate your class! This is a major milestone in their journey.

* Ask your students to think back to the very first day of class when they may have struggled with HTML and CSS. Remind them that they have grown from beginners into full-stack developers in a very short amount of time, which is a huge accomplishment. Remind students that web development is hard, and that they should celebrate not only their ability to make it all the way to final project week, but also the skills they have acquired.

* Project presentations are a rare opportunity for students to practice speaking on technical topics in front of an audience of peers.

* Limit presentations to 10 minutes: 7 or 8 for the presentation itself followed by 2 or 3 minutes for Q & A. This will ensure that every group presents and allow padding for transitions between groups.

* Prior to class, prepare a list of questions to ask each group to encourage discussion.

* Prior to class, and during presentations if necessary, collaborate with your TAs to prepare a slide deck of superlative "awards" for groups. Refer to [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Demonstrate deployed projects

* Explain the technical implementation of their projects

* Describe their individual roles and contributions to their projects

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (5 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Congratulate your class for making it this far in the course and developing their projects to a state worth presenting. This is a huge milestone for students and they should take a moment to celebrate how far they have come.

* Address any last-minute questions before presentations.

### 2. Student Do: Presentations

* Project groups will have 10 minutes to present their project and have a brief Q & A.

* If there aren't many questions, ask the group to explain how they built their application and encourage them to speak technically to some of their code.

* Present superlative 'awards' and congratulate each group for accomplishing this huge milestone!

* Take a moment with your class for some self-refection, and remind students that learning is an ongoing process.

* Remind students that they should take a moment to celebrate their accomplishments as a team, and ensure them that they have put in the time and effort to be a developer.

* Assure students that applying for positions can take some time, and they may face rejection, but to not be discouraged. Remind them to leverage personal connections and apply to as many jobs as they can, even if they don't fit all the requirements.

* Answer any questions before ending class.
