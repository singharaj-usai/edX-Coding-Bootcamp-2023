### Preclass Drill

* Let students know that it's time for the preclass drill of the day. Remind them that interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and that they need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make them great developers, and these preclass questions are designed to make them awesome interviewers.

* Encourage students to begin by pseudocoding. Remind them that many companies will judge them more on problem-solving skills than coding chops, so strong pseudocoding skills might just land them their dream job one day. Encourage some whiteboarding from students (when relevant) and explain why it's beneficial for them to practice it in the classroom rather than wait for interviews to be their first experience—but move on if there are no volunteers. Do not pressure students.

* 20 minutes before class starts, write the following on the board or send it out on Slack, and explain each part of the code:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
  
* Start recording when you review the code, and send it out on Slack at the end of office hours, before class starts.

* Make sure you touch on each of the following points:

  * `DOCTYPE`: instructions to the browser about what version of HTML is being used.

  * `head`: a container for elements about that give information about the website like the title, scripts, styles, and meta information. 

  * `meta`: data about the data on the page (think of things like language or keywords)

  * `title`: the title of the page (appears in tab)

  * `link`: links to stylesheets
  
  * `script`: links to JavaScript files

  * `body`: where the actual content that appears on the page goes
