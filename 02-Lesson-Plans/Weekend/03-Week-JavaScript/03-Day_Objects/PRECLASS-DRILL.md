### Preclass Drill

* Let students know that it's time for the preclass drill of the day. Remind them that interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and that they need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make them great developers, and these preclass questions are designed to make them awesome interviewers.

* Encourage students to begin by pseudocoding. Remind them that many companies will judge them more on problem-solving skills than coding chops, so strong pseudocoding skills might just land them their dream job one day. Encourage some whiteboarding from students (when relevant) and explain why it's beneficial for them to practice it in the classroom rather than wait for interviews to be their first experience—but move on if there are no volunteers. Do not pressure students.

* 20 minutes before class starts, write the following problem on the board or send it out on Slack:

    ```
    What is a self-closing tag? Provide three examples. Why are these tags self-closing? What differentiates these elements from others?
    ```

* After 15 minutes, ask students if they have an answer.

* Encourage students to practice their critical thinking rather than their Googling skills here.

* Be sure to praise students who provide a solution even if it isn't fully correct. Discuss its merits and potential pitfalls.

* Start recording when you review the answer, and send it out on Slack at the end of office hours, before class starts.

* Your answer may resemble the following example:

    > "**Self-closing tags** don't require a closing tag. Examples include `br`, `hr`, and `img` tags. Self-closing tags do not require a closing `/` inside the tag&mdash;but it can be preferable to add it, as some frameworks require it.
    >
    > "Self-closing tags are used for **void elements** like horizontal rules and line breaks. These are called void elements because they inherently cannot have content. There is no way to add text to a line break, so there is no need for an opening and closing set of tags. Similarly, you can't add text to a horizontal rule, so there is no need for an opening and closing set of tags. In general, any tag that can't hold text can be self-closing."
