### Preclass Drill

* Let students know that it's time for the preclass drill of the day. Remind them that interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and that they need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make them great developers, and these pre-class questions are designed to make them awesome interviewers.

* Encourage students to begin by pseudocoding. Remind them that many companies will judge them more on problem-solving skills than coding chops, so strong pseudocoding skills might just land them their dream job one day. Encourage some whiteboarding from students (when relevant) and explain why it's beneficial for them to practice it in the classroom rather than wait for interviews to be their first experience&mdash;but move on if there are no volunteers. Do not pressure students.

* 20 minutes before class starts, write the following problem on the board or send it out on Slack:

  ```
  Write a function that takes in an integer and outputs the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that integer.

  Ex:
  Input: 2
  Output: 3 (because 1 + 2 = 3)

  Input: 4
  Output: 10  (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)

  Input: 10
  Output: 55
  ```

* Give the students 15 minutes to work on the problem. 

* Encourage them to try this with pencil and paper, or at the very least to NOT use Google at all. Reassure them that you'll review the answer and that it's very important to try to tackle this one on their own.

* After 15 minutes, take 5 minutes to review the solution. You should start recording when going over the answer and send out the answer on Slack at the end of office hours before class starts.

  * Ask students if they found a solution, and review their solution (or the one below if no student solution is provided).

  * As you code the solution, be sure to talk through each line and explain why you need that line of code. For instance, for the following example, you might say, "Here I want to repeat the same task over and over a set number of times, so I need a `for` loop."

    ```js
      var totalSum = function (num) {
      var sum = 0;
      for (var i = 0; i <= num; i++) {
        sum += i;
      }
      return sum;
    }
    ```
