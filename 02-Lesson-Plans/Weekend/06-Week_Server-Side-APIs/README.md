# Module 06 Instructor Overview: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In this module, you will teach students how to use the `fetch()` method to make requests to the GitHub API and convert the returned data into HTML elements. You will also discuss the client-server model and leverage the Chrome DevTools Network tab to verify response statuses.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's Challenge.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* The MDN Web Docs use ES6 in their Fetch API examples, but our activities will continue to use ES5 syntax, because that is what students will be familiar with. We will cover ES6 syntax in Module 09, so until then, our activities will continue to use ES5 syntax.

* Along with the Fetch API, students will also briefly experiment with cURL, `XMLHttpRequest` objects, and `$.ajax()`.

* Students will use the GitHub API for activities and the OpenWeather API for their Challenge. The OpenWeather API requires signing up for a key.

* Remind students to complete this module's assessment near the end of the week. Students can find it in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

## Heads-Up

For the next two modules, students will work on their first group project. Groups should consist of three to four students each. Don't let students work on a project alone, as this is their only chance to truly learn Git collaboration.

However, there are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.
