# 08.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Project 1

## Overview

In this class, students will continue working on projects.

## Instructor Notes

* No classroom instruction today.

* You will assume the role of "scrummaster" and hold daily scrum meetings with each group. The purpose of these scrums is to: 

	1. Gauge progress on projects

	2. Course correct if scope creeps or focus shifts

	3. Most importantly, hold students accountable. Participation is a requirement for receipt of a passing grade. 

* Keep the daily scrums short. Ask each student the following questions:

	* What did you accomplish? 

	* What are your goals? 

	* Are there any obstacles? 

* Prioritize working with groups that may be at risk of failure, i.e: unable to deploy a functional application. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Make progress towards building the MVP of their project
