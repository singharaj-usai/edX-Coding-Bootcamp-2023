# 09.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Advanced ES6

## Overview

This lesson plan will cover some additional topics related to ES6 syntax. Some of the tools covered include the `for...of` loop, rest operator, spread operator, and additional Git concepts.

> **Important**: Ensure that all activities using the `inquirer` package is using version 8.2.4. The latest version of `inquirer` (version 9+) introduces breaking changes to activities. All activities have version 8.2.4 in their respective `package.json` files but should you or your students install `inquirer`, please use `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_for-of` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* This lesson covers some concepts that you might want to review to prepare for student questions:

  * [MDN Web Docs on for...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)

  * [MDN Web Docs on spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

  * [MDN Web Docs on destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this module for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Identify and implement how and when to use `for...of` loops.

* Identify and implement how and when to use the spread and rest operators.

* Use destructuring assignment syntax to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into unique variables.

* Identify and implement how and when to fork a Git repository.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class and congratulate them on learning some of the most used ES6 syntax rules.

* Reassure students that learning new syntax can be time-consuming and difficult, but it won't always feel like that. Using these rules more will allow you to commit them to memory and use less mental bandwidth going forward.

* Explain that one of the best ways to learn these new rules is to use the newer syntax whenever possible. The old syntax is still perfectly valid, and students can always fall back on it.

* These newer syntax rules are not born in a vacuum. They are the result of years of revision by a standards organization called ECMA. It is important to have standards in web development to ensure maximum compatibility across a wide spectrum of web browsers.

* The ES in ES6 stands for **ECMAScript**. ECMAScript itself is a programming language, but as far as we are concerned, it is just a language from which syntax rules are inherited. We can find a more detailed history in the [Wikipedia article on ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript).

### 2. Instructor Demo: for...of (5 min)

* Open `21-Ins_for-Of/index.js` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` after commenting out the multidimensional array example.

  * üîë Notice when we run the code that we see each value in the songs array, as follows:

    ```js
    const songs = ['Bad Guy', 'The Wheels on the Bus', 'Friday'];

    for (const value of songs) console.log(value);
    ```

  * üîë We see in the second example, we use a `for...of` loop to iterate over a multidimensional array.
  
  * üîë A multidimensional array is an array of elements where each element is another array. In other words, a multidimensional array is an array of arrays.

    ```js
    const moreSongs = [
      ['Bad Guy', 1],
      ['The Wheels on the Bus', 2],
      ['Friday', 3],
    ];

    for (const song of moreSongs) {
      console.log(song);
    }
    ```

  * üîë Explain that the `for...of` statement creates a loop iterating over objects, including `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `String`, `TypedArray`.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does the `for...of` seem to differ from a `forEach`?

  * üôã The `forEach` method only applies to arrays, while the `for...of` is much more flexible.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_for-of/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: for...of (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_for-of/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement and Use for...of Loops

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to use `for...of` loops to iterate through data inside an array.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have iterated through the `songs` array with a `for...of` loop and logged each in a cyan color.

  ## üí° Hints

  What is the iterable we will use in our `for...of` loop?

  How can we use the provided `outputCyanText()` method to console log text in a specific color?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How could you iterate through deeply nested objects?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: for...of (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the `for...of` loop? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `for...of`
  
  * ‚úîÔ∏è Iterator

* Open `22-Stu_for-of/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë The syntax for the `for...of` loop reads very similar to plain English, which helps conceptualize what is happening in the program.

  * üîë The syntax is relatively straightforward. The key takeaway is knowing when to use and what to use it for.
  
* Navigate to `22-Stu_for-of/Solved/` in your terminal and run `node index` from the command line to demonstrate the following:

  * When we run the `index.js` file, we notice that a song list containing Spotify's top 10 tracks in a cyan color:

    ```console
    Spotify top 10:

    1: MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name)
    2: Peaches (feat. Daniel Caesar & Giveon)
    3: Kiss Me More (feat. SZA)
    4: Astronaut In The Ocean
    5: Save Your Tears (with Ariana Grande) (Remix)
    6. RAPSTAR
    7. Levitating (feat. DaBaby)
    8. Leave The Door Open
    9. Botella Tras Botella
    10. Fiel
    ```
  
  * Provided to us is a helper function, `outputCyanText` that will uses ANSI escape codes to output text in a specific color to the terminal.

    > ANSI Escape codes indicate cursor location, color, font styling, and other options inside text-based terminals.

    ```js
    const outputCyanText = (text) => console.log(`\x1b[36m${text}\x1b[0m`);
    ```
  
  * This is the result of using the `for...of` loop to iterate over each item in the `songs` array and invoke the provided `outputCyanText()` method with the song's title:

    ```js
    for (const song of songs) {
      outputCyanText(song);
    }
    ```

  * üîë If you forget the syntax, VS Code can help you create these types of loops by offering a snippet to work from. You can try it yourself by typing `forof` and simply pressing Enter, which will result in the following code:

    ```js
    for (const iterator of object) {
        
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do you know when to use a `for...of` loop?

  * üôã A `for of` loop is used to iterate over each element of an object. Arrays and strings are examples of iterable objects that are capable of returning each element one at a time.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on for...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Rest and Spread Operators (5 min)

* Navigate to `23-Ins_Rest-and-Spread/index.js` in your IDE and run `node index.js` from the command line to demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we run the file, we get output for a few different operations: without the rest parameter, with the rest parameter, without spread operator, and with spread operator, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    function add(x, y) {
      return x + y;
    }

    console.log(add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) // => 3
    ```

  * It is possible to call a function with any number of arguments, but only the first two will be counted.
  
  * Let's examine this function using rest parameters, as follows:

    ```js
    function add(...nums) {
      let sum = 0;
      for (let num of nums) sum += num;
      return sum;
    }

    add(1) // => 1
    add(3,3) // => 6
    add(1, 1, 4, 5) // => 11
    ```

  * In this example, we use rest parameters `(...nums)` to collect all of the arguments into a `nums` array, enabling us to pass in as many arguments as we want.

  * Now let's review the following example:

    ```js
    function howManyArgs(...args) {
      return `You passed ${args.length} arguments.`; // point out the template literal
    }

    console.log(howManyArgs(0, 1)); // You have passed 2 arguments.
    console.log(howManyArgs("argument!", null, ["one", 2, "three"], 4)); // You have passed 4 arguments.
    ```

  * üîë  The takeaway here is that variables are now available inside the array of the function. We can also pass as many in as we want.

  * üîë  The spread operator `...` allows iterables like arrays, objects, and strings to be expanded into single arguments or elements.
  
  * You can compare this to pouring items out of a cup. The only difference is that the items are variables and the cup is an iterable.

  * In the following example, we have expanded both arrays into a new array with all of the elements:

    ```js
    // Spread Operator

    let dragons = ['Drogon', 'Viserion', 'Rhaegal'];
    let weapons = ['dragonglass', ...dragons, 'wildfire']; // notice the spread operator ...dragons

    console.log(weapons); // prints ["dragonglass", "Drogon", "Viserion", "Rhaegal", "wildfire"]

    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why does the first example of the `add()` function only output `3`?

  * üôã Because only the first and second parameter get counted without the use of the rest operator.
  
  * ‚òùÔ∏è The syntax for spread and rest are similar, but what is the difference between the two?

  * üôã The rest parameter allows us to pass in any number of arguments, while the spread operator allows us to spread out an iterable into unique variables.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Rest-and-Spread/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Rest and Spread Operators (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Rest-and-Spread/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üìê Add Comments to Implementation and Use of Rest and Spread Operators

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [index.js](./Unsolved/index.js).

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

* [MDN Web Docs on spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

* [MDN Web Docs on rest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)

* [MDN Web Docs on reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)

---

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other data types can you use the spread operator or rest parameters on?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Rest and Spread Operators (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `rest parameters` and `spread operators`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Spread operator syntax (`...`)

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `reduce()` method

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Rest parameter syntax (`...`)

* Open `24-Stu_Rest-and-Spread/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë In the first exercise, we are using the spread operator to copy the items in the `songs` array to the `new_songs` array. Much like we would be dumping out the contents of a cup, we are populating the `new_songs` array with the items in `songs`, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    const songs = ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
    const new_songs = [...songs];

    console.log(new_songs); // => ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
    ```

  * üîë In the second exercise, we use the `reduce()` method to execute a reducer function on each element of the array. In our case, the reducer function was adding all the numbers up.

    ```js
    const addition = (x, y, z) => {
      const array = [x, y, z];
      return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    };
    ```
  
  * üîë Then we modified the `addition()` function to make use of the rest parameters. The `additionSpread()` function allows us to pass in as many arguments as we need. This is particularly useful in this case where we want to add as many numbers as necessary.

    ```js
    const additionSpread = (...array) => {
      return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    };
    ```

  * If we run `node index.js` in our command line, we will see the results of the console.logs.

    ```js
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // => 6
    console.log(additionSpread(1, 2, 3)); // => 6
    console.log(additionSpread(1, 2, 3, 4, 100)); // => 110
    ```

  * There is a good chance that students might be confused on where spread operators and rest parameters go, because they are very similar and can be used in similar situations. This is just an introduction; assure students that they will begin to pick up fluency as they get more practice.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does the `reduce()` method help us with in this exercise?

  * üôã The `reduce()` method reduces an array to a single value. It takes a callback function and runs that function for each value in the array starting from the left to the right.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) and the [MDN Web Docs on rest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Object Destructuring (5 min)

* Open `25-Ins_Obj-Destructuring/index.js` in your browser.

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Notice that when we run the `index.js` file we see several variables logged to the terminal. Each of these are different ways of accessing variables inside an object.

  * üîë Also, in the file, we are using dot notation to access variables inside an object, as we have in the past. We are plucking off certain variables and setting them equal to the value of the object. This is done with curly braces on the left side of the equals sign, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const arya = {
      name: 'Arya Stark',
      parents: ['Eddard Stark', 'Catelyn Stark'],
    };

    const { name, parents } = arya;
    ```

  * You can now also use object destructuring as a way to pluck off certain variables from an object. Consider the following example:

    ```js
    const betterLogCharacter = ({ name, parents }) =>
    console.log(`${name}'s parents are: ${parents[0]} and ${parents[1]}.`);

    betterLogCharacter(jaime);
    ```

  * Destructuring assignment can also be used on arrays. Consider the following example:

    ```js
    const locations = ['Winterfell', 'Casterly Rock', 'Kings Landing'];
    const [winterfell, casterlyRock, kingLanding] = locations;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We could look up examples of object destructuring and get a feel for the logic before attempting the activity.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Obj-Destructuring/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Object Destructuring (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Obj-Destructuring/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üìñ Implement and Recognize Object Destructuring

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to pull out data from objects and arrays into variables.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have destructured the objects to pull out the data that is logged in the console.

* It's done when I have destructured the array to pull out the data that is logged in the console.

* It's done when I have run `node index.js` after destructuring to confirm the values logged in the console.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MDN Web Docs on object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

---

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we take a property from an object and assign it to a variable with a different name when we are destructuring it?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 10. Instructor Review: Object Destructuring (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with object destructuring? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Destructuring objects

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Destructuring arrays

* Open `26-Stu_Obj-Destructuring/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * This exercise highlights how we can pluck off multiple properties at once, saving us a few lines of code.

  * We can also destructure function parameters. This allows us to name them directly and again save a few steps.  

  * Now we can simply expect an object and pull the properties off without worrying about the order they're passed in or writing extra code to destructure them the old way.

  * In the past, if we wanted to cherry-pick an object's properties, we'd have to do something like the following example:

    ```js
    const nodejs = {
      pkgName: 'Node.js',
      type: 'JavaScript runtime environment',
    };

    const nodejsName = nodejs.name;
    const nodejsType = nodejs.type;

    console.log(nodejsName); // <= Node.js
    console.log(nodejsType); // <= JavaScript runtime environment
    ```

  * üîë  With ES6 object destructuring syntax, we can destructure data based on their property key names:

    ```js
    const { name, type } = nodejs;

    console.log(name); // <= Node.js
    console.log(type); // <= JavaScript runtime environment
    ```

  * üîë For a nested object, we need to be more specific:

    ```js
    const { framework1, framework2 } = js.tools.frameworks;

    console.log(framework1); // <= AngularJS
    console.log(framework2); // <= Vue.js
    ```

  * üîë For arrays, we can destructure data by the index:

    ```js
    const languages = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript'];

    const [markup, style, scripting] = languages;

    console.log(markup, style, scripting); // <= HTML CSS JavaScript
    console.log(markup); // <= HTML
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Does the order matter when passing destructured object properties into a function?

  * üôã No! Because we are referring to the properties in the object by name, the key names will align with the correct value every time.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã  We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Fork/README.md`.

### 11. Everyone Do: Git Fork (20 min)

* Open [Git docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) in your browser and explain the following:

* Fork allows you to contribute to a repository that you don't have push access to. When you fork a project, GitHub will make an exact copy of the project that will live on your account that you can push to.
  
* This workflow then allows you to create a pull request to the parent repository when you have finished your contributions. This is a very common workflow in many open source projects.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Fork/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

* Open your browser and choose a repository to fork. Click the green fork button.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * After we clone the repository, we will want to visit our own fork on GitHub and copy the Git URL to clone it the local machine. After that, we change into the directory for our forked repository:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/forking-tutorial.git && cd forking-tutorial
    ```

  * üîë After you clone the local repository, run the following command to demonstrate that the remote is pointed to your namespace rather than the parent repository:

    ```sh
    git remote -v
    ```

* Answer any questions before students go on break.

### 12. BREAK (40 min)

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project (5 min)

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Notice that when we run the application, we are presented with a series of prompts by `inquirer`.

  * üîë After the inputs are entered, we are presented with a message that `index.html` has been written to.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We would import `inquirer`, gather the required responses from the user and use those responses in conjunction with the `fs` module to write some html to a file. It will also require some creative string concatenation.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini-project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (60 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Mini-Project

In this activity, you will build a command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from user input.

## Instructions

* Your application should prompt the user for information like their name, location, bio, LinkedIn URL, and GitHub URL. Feel free to add any additional prompts you think of.

* An HTML document containing the information collected from the prompts should be constructed and written to the file system. Be sure to add some CSS styling to the document.

* You‚Äôll need the following tools and technologies to accomplish this:

  * `fs` for writing to the file system

  * `inquirer` for collecting user input

  * String template literals for generating a string version of the HTML document before it is written to the file system

## üí° Hints

It might be a good idea to start building out the HTML skeleton in a real HTML file. Once you're happy with the HTML file's appearance in the browser, you can copy and paste its contents into a string template literal. Then you can write a function to insert the user input into the appropriate places in the HTML string before writing it to the file system.

## üèÜ Bonus

* Instead of using callback functions, what are some other tools in JavaScript we can use to handle asynchronous functionality?
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Template literal syntax

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `inquirer.prompt()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `fs.writeFile()`

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We import the required packages first, as follows:

    ```js
    const inquirer = require("inquirer");
    const fs = require("fs");
    ```

  * üîë We destructure our `answers` object to retrieve the values we desire to fill in our template.
  
  * üîë We can construct an HTML string using string template literals in the function `generateHTML()`:

    ```js
    function generateHTML({ name, location, github, linkedin }) {
      return `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
      <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
      <div class="container">
        <h1 class="display-4">Hi! My name is ${name}</h1>
        <p class="lead">I am from ${location}.</p>
        <h3>Example heading <span class="badge badge-secondary">Contact Me</span></h3>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">My GitHub username is ${github}</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">LinkedIn: ${linkedin}</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    </body>
    </html>`;
    }
    ```

  * üîë  `inquirer.prompt({})` will collect the needed responses from the user and assign them to an object for us. We called the object `answers`, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    inquirer.prompt([
      {
        type: "input",
        name: "name",
        message: "What is your name?"
      },
      {
        type: "input",
        name: "location",
        message: "Where are you from?"
      },
      {
        type: "input",
        name: "hobby",
        message: "What is your favorite hobby?"
      },
      {
        type: "input",
        name: "food",
        message: "What is your favorite food?"
      },
      {
        type: "input",
        name: "github",
        message: "Enter your GitHub Username"
      },
      {
        type: "input",
        name: "linkedin",
        message: "Enter your LinkedIn URL."
      }
    ]);
    ```

  * üîë  We then use `fs.writeFile()` inside of the Promise returned by `inquirer.prompt()` to generate the HTML file with our answers:

    ```js
    fs.writeFile('index.html', htmlPageContent, (err) =>
      err ? console.log(err) : console.log('Successfully created index.html!')
    );
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can asynchronous code help developers write better code?

  * üôã Asynchronous programming allows the code to execute logic without blocking the rest of the application‚Äôs functionality.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (5 min)

* Navigate to `02-Challenge/Main` and run `npm i` in your command line.

* Run `node index.js` from your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * We will build a command-line application that will generate READMEs for us.

  * You might actually want to use this application for all your Challenges in the future. It will also help keep each of your projects looking professional when you are applying for jobs.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning how to use `inquirer` to gather responses from the user, how to use `fs` to write the content to a markdown file, and also how to use the responses to inject data into the template strings.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã Much like the mini-project, we will be using the `inquirer` responses to write to a file.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã It will help us learn how to use Node's `fs` module. It also carries an added benefit of helping keep readme files looking fresh. Employers often view job seekers' pinned projects on GitHub, and a sleek readme can be the difference between piquing their interest or seeing them move on to the next candidate.

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Challenge Requirements found in `02-Challenge/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
