### Preclass Drill

* Let students know that it's time for the preclass drill of the day. Remind them that interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and that they need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make them great developers, and these pre-class questions are designed to make them awesome interviewers.

* Encourage students to begin by pseudocoding. Remind them that many companies will judge them more on problem-solving skills than coding chops, so strong pseudocoding skills might just land them their dream job one day. Encourage some whiteboarding from students (when relevant) and explain why it's beneficial for them to practice it in the classroom rather than wait for interviews to be their first experience—but move on if there are no volunteers. Do not pressure students.

* 20 minutes before class starts, write the following question on the board or send it out on Slack:

  * What is Node.js?

* Remind students that there are multiple kinds of interview questions. We've largely practiced coding problems, but they should expect to encounter discussion problems as well.

* Encourage students not to use Google. Ask that they write their own definition of Node.js.

* If you want, end the activity 5 minutes early and let students refer to Google to enhance their answer.
 
* After 15 minutes, take 5 minutes to review the answer. ou should start recording when going over the answer and send out the answer on Slack at the end of office hours before class starts.

  * Ask students if they found a solution and review their solution (or the ones below if no student solution is provided). 

  * Be sure to praise students who provide a solution even if it isn't fully correct. 

  * Ensure that you cover the following points:

    * Node.js is a run-time environment that runs JavaScript outside the browser.

    * Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to build web servers, stand-alone desktop applications, phone apps, and more.
