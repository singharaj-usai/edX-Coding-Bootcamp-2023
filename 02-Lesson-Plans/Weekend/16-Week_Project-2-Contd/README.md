# Module 16 Instructor Overview: Project 2 Continued

## Overview

In this module, students will continue to work on their second project and present their projects to the class at the end of the module. They'll also begin to revise their professional materials, including their portfolios, and add their projects once they've completed them.

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's group project.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before presentation day.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

In the next module, you'll be taking a look at how computer science relates to what students have learned so far with JavaScript. We recommend that you take a moment to review topics that pertain to data structures, the JavaScript event loop, and closures. Keep in mind that these topics can be hard for students to grasp, but it's important to learn because it will help students prepare for the technical interview phase of any software job.
