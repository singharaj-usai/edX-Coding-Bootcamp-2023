# Full-Stack Part-Time Weekend Lesson Plans

## Challenge 

For Part-Time Weekend students, each Challenge is assigned on the first day of the week (or module if the calendar is shifted by a holiday or event) and is due _the following_ Saturday, so students have nearly two weeks to submit.

**Note**: The following are default days of the week that Challenges are assigned/due in BCS and are subject to change with holidays.

### Monday/Tuesday - After Class

**Note**: Students receive Challenge instructions and starter code in Canvas, but you may want to add them to the class repo as well.

* Copy the new Challenge instructions and, if applicable, the starter code inside the `Develop` folder into the class repo.

### Saturday of the Following Week - After Class

**Note**: Students do not receive solution code in Canvas.

* Last week's Challenge is due.

* Copy the Challenge solution code inside the `Main` folder for the prior Challenge assignment into the class repo. 

## Career Connection

Each week, students receive Career Connections in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas that tie what we do in the classroom to the profession, along with technical interviewing practice.
