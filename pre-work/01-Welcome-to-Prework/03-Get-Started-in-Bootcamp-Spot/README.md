## Navigate Bootcamp Spot
Bootcamp Spot navigation consists of **global navigation**, **course navigation**, and **module navigation**.

* **Course navigation** is used to move between the different areas of your course, like Syllabus, Modules, Slack, Grades, and People. Course navigation is found just to the right of the global navigation and can be collapsed for more screen space:

## Update Your Time Zone
Because this is an online course, it's likely that your classmates and instructional team will span multiple time zones. Check to make sure that your time zone is correct so that you don’t miss an important deadline or live session.

1. In the global navigation menu on the lefthand side of the screen, click Account:
