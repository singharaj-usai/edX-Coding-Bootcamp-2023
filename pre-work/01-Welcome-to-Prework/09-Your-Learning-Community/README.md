# 1.9.1 Your Learning Community

As you complete this prework and prepare for the boot camp, you might be tempted into believing that this is a solitary journey you're undertaking. Nothing could be further from the truth.

The boot camp will create a community of like-minded, fledgling developers (that's you and your classmates!), technology and career professionals, and subject matter experts. This is an opportunity to grow your professional network exponentially, make lifelong friends, and truly change your life. So be ready to take advantage of this learning community!

## Don't Wait to Make Connections

The time to make connections doesn't start after your class ends. It begins the first time you attend a class, the first time you attend a meetup group, or at your first tech event. Remember that who you know really does make a difference—not only in terms of potential job opportunities, but also the chance to learn from those with different perspectives and experiences.

## Get to Know Your Classmates

No matter your level of knowledge coming into this boot camp, every student is going through the same process. Many of you will have similar doubts and fears, and hopes and expectations.

As you work through the coursework, follow these tips:

* Reach out to other students to form real or virtual study groups (using Zoom)

* Create private channels in Slack to discuss concepts and ideas for applications

* Leverage your classmates' knowledge in addition to the support team you already have

## Coding Is Collaborative

You'll complete some of the work for this class on your own, but it's important to remember that coding is a collaborative process. Any professional role you assume after the boot camp will require a great deal of teamwork, and this boot camp is your chance to practice that.

You'll have opportunities in the classes to pair up with other students to complete activities and think through concepts. There are also three group projects that are required to complete the course. These are your best opportunities to practice teamwork and collaborative coding, and you might be asked to describe the process during a job interview. Take advantage of these as enthusiastically as you can!

The community of learning that you build in this boot camp will provide a bridge to your future endeavours. How strong that bridge is is largely up to how much effort you put into building it.
