# 2.1.1 Get Started

Congratulations! You've already made big strides toward your career in web development. Your first step was signing up for the boot camp. The second step will be completing this prework.

The boot camp will present many challenges. This prework provides the information and guidance you need to succeed during the first few weeks of the course. The time and effort required to complete it will also give you a taste of what the course will be like. Just remember that perfection isn't everything. Give each of these lessons your all, and submit whatever you create. You'll have the rest of the course to smooth out the edges.

Good luck!

## How to Prioritize

Complete the prework lessons in the order in which they're listed. You should try to complete all of the lessons in the prework. If your time is limited, we recommend prioritizing the first six lessons. If you're starting the prework just a few days before your boot camp starts, prioritize Lessons 1–3 and attempt to complete Lessons 4–6.

## What You'll Learn in the Boot Camp

After you finish this prework, you will move onto the boot camp. The boot camp is divided into three equal phases: Foundation, Technical, and Performance.

## Phase 1: Foundation

The Foundation phase covers the fundamental concepts of web development, including front-end technologies, command-line fundamentals, and APIs.

In this phase, you'll learn the following skills:

* HTML and CSS

* Git

* JavaScript

* Third-party APIs (jQuery, Bootstrap)

* Server-side APIs, AJAX, and JSON

## Phase 2: Technical

In the Technical phase, you'll learn the skills necessary to engineer a complete full-stack web application. This includes working with servers, databases, and other back-end technologies and connecting them to the front end.

In this phase, you'll learn the following skills:

* Node.js

* Object-oriented programming (OOP)

* Express servers

* MySQL

* Object-relational mapper, or ORM (Sequelize)

* Model-view-controller (MVC) framework (Handlebars.js)

* Unit testing

* Agile methodology

* Heroku

## Phase 3: Performance

The Performance phase has a dual meaning, in that you'll learn how to optimize your web applications for speed and efficiency as well as prepare yourself for the transition to a career in web development.

In this phase, you'll learn the following skills:

* Computer science

* MongoDB and NoSQL

* Progressive web apps (PWAs)

* React

* MERN

* Portfolios
