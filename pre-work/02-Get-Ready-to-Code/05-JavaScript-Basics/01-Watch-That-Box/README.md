# Watch That Box

In this assignment, you'll use JavaScript to change the CSS properties of a box with button clicks.

## Before You Begin

You might want to spend time reading through each of the following resources to familiarize yourself with some basics:

* [onClick Events](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp)

* [JavaScript Click Examples](http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_events_onclick)

* [JavaScript HTML DOM Events](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_events.asp)

## Instructions

1. Create two files in VS Code. Name one file `index.html` and the other `javascript.js`. These should be in the same folder or directory. You can name this folder something like `watch-that-box`.

2. Copy and save the following code in your HTML file. This is your starting HTML:

```htm
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Watch That Box</title>
</head>
<body>

    <p>Press the buttons to change the box!</p>

    <div id="box" style="height:150px; width:150px; background-color:orange; margin:25px"></div>

    <button id="button1">Grow</button>
    <button id="button2">Blue</button>
    <button id="button3">Fade</button>
    <button id="button4">Reset</button>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="javascript.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

3. Write your JavaScript in the `javascript.js` file so that clicking the buttons restyles the box appropriately. When a user clicks Grow, the box should increase in size; when a user clicks Fade, the box should change opacity; and so on.

4. Upload both your HTML file and JavaScript file.

## Helpful Hints

* Push yourself here. Be resourceful and use Google searches if you get stuck. There's plenty of material to learn from.

* If you don't quite get it to work, submit what you have! There's no shame in not knowing just yet. You've got the whole course to figure this stuff out.

## Bonus

Try adding a few buttons of your own with different CSS effects. You can do a lot more than box-changing with JavaScript, but it's a fun start!
