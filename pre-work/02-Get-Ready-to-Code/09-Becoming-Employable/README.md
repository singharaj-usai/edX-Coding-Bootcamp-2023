# 2.9.1 Becoming Employable

Throughout this program, you'll work closely with the career services team to prepare for your job search after the course. The goal of the career services team can be summed up in a single word: empowerment. They aim to motivate you, offer support, and provide strategies for reaching beyond your comfort zone to find the right opportunity. Remember, the more information you share with career services, the better equipped they'll be to help in your job search.

## Career Services Resource Library

The [Career Engagement Network](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp) provides guides and templates to help you navigate the job search. Visit this library often to supplement your career curriculum and find the resources you need to be successful. You will also find links to optional events aimed at getting you employer ready.

## What to Expect on the Job Hunt

A reasonable timeline for transitioning to a new career—from applying for positions to accepting a company's offer—is anywhere from 30 to 90 days. Throughout this program, you'll spend time networking and developing a professional narrative to market yourself to employers.

## What You DO Need to Succeed

* A professional narrative that showcases your strengths, skills, and passions.

* An ability to showcase your previous skills and how they add to your value as a technology professional.

* A friendly demeanor—people hire people they like!

* An ability to talk about technology using technical language.

* Practice, practice, practice. The more interviews and networking events you attend, the more prepared you'll be for your next opportunity.

# What You DON'T Need to Succeed

* Code that looks perfect. Remember, no one's code is perfect! As long as it works, you're golden!

* Proficiency with all technologies taught in this course. You'll learn so much in this boot camp that it'll make your head spin. Remind yourself that you don't need to be an expert in everything in only a few weeks. Focus on learning how to teach yourself new technologies via online resources.

* Previous coding experience. If you don't have prior experience in this field, don't worry! Many companies will let you learn on the job, and they'll appreciate the unique perspective and skill set that you bring to the table.

* Every skill listed in the job description. Job descriptions can be misleading, especially if written by someone who isn't familiar with technology (as is often the case). Apply even if you're unsure whether you fit every requirement in the description. Use your cover letter to showcase your strengths, like an ability to learn quickly. (Your boot camp experience is a great example!)

* A certificate of completion from the boot camp. Once we've approved your career profile, you're ready to start applying to jobs! Don't be afraid to start early. Practice makes perfect, and you'll only get better with each interview.

## Professional Websites to Join

The following key (and free!) resources will put you on the path to your new career:

* Join [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/) to get the latest news, insights, and opportunities from over 3 million companies. LinkedIn allows you to set up a professional profile, get free career advice and tips, and connect with companies, recruiters, and other professionals.

* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is like the Wikipedia of code. In this online community, developers share their knowledge, ask questions, sharpen their skills, and help solve coding problems.

* [Angel List](http://angel.co/) is a website that helps investors, startups, and job seekers connect.

You'll use [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) to submit the first several career homework assignments.
