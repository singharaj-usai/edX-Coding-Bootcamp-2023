# Be Original!

A boot camp can be difficult. At times, you might feel overwhelmed or frustrated. Try to remember that the goal of this program is to learn valuable skills. Don't be afraid to reach out. You have many available resources, including Slack, office hours, and tutoring sessions.

No matter how difficult the course becomes, you must always turn in original work. Plagiarism is not tolerated. If your instructional staff or student success managers determine that you've plagiarized work, your student success manager will determine the appropriate course of action. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, a documented plagiarism discussion, an incomplete grade assignment, or ineligibility for graduation.

## What Is Plagiarism?

Plagiarism is the presentation of material, concepts, or products from another person, group, or entity as your own work without citation or reference. Acts of plagiarism may include but are not limited to the following:

* Copying the direct words or images of another person without using quotation marks or citing the original source.

* Presenting another’s ideas in your own words without acknowledging the original source.

* Failing to acknowledge collaborators on homework and project assignments.

* Submitting work that you previously wrote for an assignment in another class without identifying it as such (self-plagiarism).

* Using, paraphrasing, or copying content, statistics, images, and other materials directly from blogs, websites, or online publications without citing the original source.

* Submitting downloaded papers, slide decks, or other documents without citing the original source.

* Taking code written by another person and presenting it as your own work.

This definition from the [University of Birmingham School of Computer Science](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/registry/policy/conduct/plagiarism/index.aspx) provides additional details about avoiding plagiarism as it relates to code:

"Almost all computer programs contain many ideas borrowed from elsewhere. Many also contain short sections of actual code copied from elsewhere. For example, writing a section of program to create a new window on screen with a menu at the top of the window is often done by simply copying a few lines of code from an example in a programming manual or textbook, either with or without a few minor changes. This is normally regarded as fair use and typically requires no acknowledgement.

Any more significant copying of code from elsewhere should be acknowledged, however. The acknowledgement can be put in comments within the program itself. Reference to the source of the original material should be made in the same way as in essays or other documents (except that it may not be possible to use italics or other font variations). Obviously, it isn't possible to put sections of code in quotation marks to indicate that they have been taken directly from elsewhere. Instead, the comments should make it clear which sections of code have been copied from elsewhere. Equally, the comments should make it clear when the basic method has been copied from elsewhere, but changes made to the details."

You may share ideas among peers as long as you cite all sources accordingly.

## Tips to Avoid Plagiarism

Follow these tips to help ensure that you meet boot camp standards for submitting original work while avoiding plagiarism:

## Cite All Borrowed Content
When using a portion of someone else’s content, be sure to either put the material in quotation marks, use an in-text citation, or cite the source in your notes. Where possible, include a link to the original source, the name of the author, and the name of the publication from which you derived the content, and the date of publication in your citation.

Assignments submitted as Google Slides or PowerPoint presentations carry the same rules as a paper or report; as long as you provide a proper citation, it's acceptable to quote from someone else’s work to reach your goal or illustrate an idea.

Try to follow general APA citation style guides when citing your sources. For more information, go to [Purdue Online Writing Lab’s page on citing electronic resources](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_electronic_sources.html).

## Use Your Own Designs

During the boot camp, you may look at other people’s work for design inspiration. While you might use the same color palettes, typefaces, or assets, it is unacceptable to copy the entire visual composition of someone else's work. Make it your own.

## Cite All Borrowed Code

Whenever you use a portion of someone else’s code, be sure to provide a web link and the source of the material as a comment.

Think of writing code like writing an essay: it's totally acceptable to quote a few sentences from someone else’s work, but copying an entire work and passing it off as your own is unacceptable.

## Comment Your Code

Use comments to break down how your code functions. Thoughtfully commenting on code will benefit you in a variety of ways. Most industries that involve coding expect developers to use easy-to-read code with comments that detail functionality. This best practice enables collaborators to engage more easily with the work.

## Commit to GitHub Early and Often

When you complete a step or fix a bug, commit your code to GitHub. This provides you and your instructional staff with a visible way to track the evolution of your code, bit by bit. Frequent commitment to GitHub—an industry standard—helps prevent collaboration obstacles.

## Additional Resources

Remember, copying someone else's work and passing it off as your own violates an ethical code between you, your fellow students, and the original creator of the work. The following additional resources can help you understand best practices for avoiding plagiarism and offer guidelines and tools to help you create proper citations.
